## 1. Why this capstone matters

The bootcamp prepares early-career developers for **enterprise Java full-stack roles**. Week 6 is not another technology survey. It is a **controlled delivery simulation** that asks teams to prove they can move a coherent product from architecture through production-style release.

| Sponsor question | Capstone answer |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Can they ship a vertical feature, not only a tutorial? | Teams deliver one coherent Customer Management Platform slice end to end. |
| Will they leave reproducible evidence? | Live demos require docs, tests, pipeline runs, and deployment proof another engineer can follow. |
| Do they understand enterprise constraints? | Security, roles, correlation/traceability, rollback, and residual-risk ownership are scored—not optional. |
| Can they communicate under review? | Week ends with a formal stakeholder demo, technical defense, Q&A, and blameless retrospective. |

**Bottom line:** Graduates leave Week 6 with portfolio-grade evidence of planning, implementation, quality, security, CI/CD, deployment, and professional defense—aligned to how real teams release software.

## 2. Product under delivery

### 2.1 One-paragraph description

Service agents use a **React** application to search and manage customers and record interactions. A **Spring Boot** API enforces **JWT / role-based access control**, persists data in **PostgreSQL** via **Spring Data JPA**, and publishes **versioned Kafka** events for processing and audit. Delivery is proven through **GitHub Actions** (build, test, security scanning), **immutable Docker images**, **Kubernetes (k3s)** deployment, smoke tests, observability, and a documented **rollback** path. The week closes with a formal technical defense and retrospective.

### 2.2 Business scenario

A large enterprise needs a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) / Customer Management Platform** for service agents. Capstone teams must deliver a coherent platform—not five disconnected demos—with clear traceability from business outcomes through architecture, backlog, tests, security, deployment, and operations.

Synthetic demo customers only (no real customer data):

| Customer ID | Persona | Typical journey |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `CUS-1001` | Amina Khan (ACTIVE) | Search → profile → interaction timeline |
| `CUS-1002` | Ravi Singh (PROSPECT → ACTIVE) | Onboarding / status change journey |
| `CUS-9999` | (synthetic not-found) | Negative paths and error handling |

### 2.3 Functional scope

| Area | Capabilities demonstrated |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| Customer management | Create, update, search, and managed customer lifecycle |
| Interactions | Record durable customer interactions with verified persistence |
| Events | Publish and consume versioned customer / audit events (Kafka) |
| Security | JWT authentication and role-based authorization (e.g., AGENT / ADMIN) |
| Operations | Health checks, logging/metrics, smoke tests, monitored release, rollback plan |

### 2.4 Non-functional expectations

Teams define **measurable** NFRs covering security, traceability, recoverability, performance, and operability—then prove them with evidence in Labs 49–52. Vague goals such as “fast” or “secure” without thresholds and verification methods do not meet the success standard.

## 3. Week 6 structure (Modules 48–52)

| Phase | Module | Lab | What participants produce |
| ----- | ------ | --- | ------------------------- |
| **Plan** | 48 | [Lab 48](module-48/lab48/LAB-48-GUIDE.md) | C4 context/containers, measurable NFRs, ADRs, prioritized backlog, risk register, ownership plan |
| **Backend** | 49 | [Lab 49](module-49/lab49/LAB-49-GUIDE.md) | Spring Boot vertical slice, service/repository layers, Kafka producer/consumer, unit & integration tests |
| **Full stack** | 50 | [Lab 50](module-50/lab50/LAB-50-GUIDE.md) | React agent journey + PostgreSQL/JPA end-to-end flow, accessible UI, UI→DB verification |
| **Release** | 51 | [Lab 51](module-51/lab51/LAB-51-GUIDE.md) | JWT/RBAC hardening, GitHub pipeline gates, Docker digests, k3s deploy, smoke + rollback |
| **Defend** | 52 | [Lab 52](module-52/lab52/LAB-52-GUIDE.md) | Stakeholder demo, evidence-backed Q&A, architecture review, retrospective, individual reflection |

**Style:** Team-based delivery (recommended 3–5 people) with peer review and evidence gates. Instructors coach for enterprise standards; sponsors may attend the final defense by invitation.

## 6. Deliverables and expected evidence

### By phase

| Phase | Deliverables |
| ----- | ------------ |
| Planning (48) | Architecture context/container docs, measurable NFRs, ADRs, prioritized backlog, risk register |
| Implementation (49–50) | Backend slice + Kafka, React journey + PostgreSQL persistence, automated tests, reproduction notes |
| Release (51) | Security negatives, CI/CD + SAST evidence, image digest, deploy evidence, smoke + rollback |
| Defense (52) | Presentation, demo script, **evidence index**, Q&A notes, retrospective, reflection, self-score |

### Evidence pack (reviewer checklist)

Teams prepare artifacts another engineer can use to understand, reproduce, and assess the work:

- Architecture diagram and design notes  
- Team roles and working agreements  
- Prioritized backlog and delivery plan  
- Risk register with mitigations  
- Source for backend, frontend, persistence, and messaging  
- Unit, integration, UI, smoke, and security test results  
- CI/CD pipeline run evidence  
- Infrastructure automation evidence (as assigned)  
- Kubernetes (k3s) deployment evidence  
- Final demo script / walkthrough notes  
- Technical defense notes  
- Team retrospective and individual reflection  

---

## 7. Success standard

| Standard | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| Demo alone is not enough | A green happy path without evidence receives limited credit. |
| Reproducibility | Another engineer can follow documentation and recreate the result. |
| Evidence over assertion | Claims map to sanitized reports, logs, tests, pipeline runs, or repository links. |
| Failure paths matter | At least one controlled negative / failure path is verified and explained (per lab). |
| Honest residual risk | Incomplete work or accepted risks have owners and due dates. |
| No real PII / secrets | Synthetic data only; secrets stay out of Git and shared packs. |

Assessment focuses on **reasoning, safety, recoverability, and evidence**—not memorizing sample host names.

## 8. Evaluation rubrics

### 8.1 Overall Week 6 score (100 points)

Used for sponsor-facing week assessment and Lab 52 self-reconciliation.

| Category | Points | Full-credit indicators |
| -------- | -----: | ---------------------- |
| Architecture and planning | 15 | Roles, prioritized backlog, full-stack architecture, CI/CD plan, risks and mitigations |
| Backend and messaging | 20 | Working Spring Boot services, layered design, Kafka integration, review evidence, tests |
| Frontend and persistence | 15 | React journey connected to APIs, PostgreSQL via Spring Data JPA, validated end-to-end flow |
| Testing and quality | 15 | Unit, integration, UI/smoke checks; repeatable validation; documented fixes or limitations |
| Security, CI/CD, and deployment | 20 | SAST evidence, pipeline execution, containers, k3s deploy, readiness / rollback |
| Final defense and professionalism | 15 | Stakeholder demo, strong Q&A, design tradeoffs, evidence index, retrospective, reflection |
| **Total** | **100** | |

### 8.2 Per-lab coaching rubric (100 marks each)

The same rubric applies to Labs 48–52 during coaching days. Lab 52 additionally requires a rehearsed defense packet and rubric-based self-assessment.

| Criterion | Marks | Full-credit evidence |
| --------- | ----: | -------------------- |
| Scope and baseline | 8 | Clear scope and recorded starting state |
| Technical implementation | 25 | Correct, maintainable lab-specific work |
| Security and safe configuration | 12 | Least privilege, no secrets, negative test |
| Automated validation | 15 | Repeatable happy-path and failure-path checks |
| Operational readiness | 10 | Useful health, logs, metrics, pipeline, or rollout evidence |
| Recovery and risk management | 10 | Verified recovery and explicit residual risks |
| Documentation | 12 | Another engineer can reproduce the work |
| Peer review and professionalism | 8 | Focused feedback and clean submission |
| **Total** | **100** | |

### 8.3 Final team evaluation (4-point weighted scale)

Modeled on the Platform Engineer Networking Capstone rubric style. Full descriptors live in [Java_Software_Engineer_Capstone_Rubric.docx](Java_Software_Engineer_Capstone_Rubric.docx).

| Criterion | Weight |
| --------- | -----: |
| Full-Stack Architecture & Planning | 15% |
| Backend Services & Messaging | 20% |
| Frontend & Persistence | 15% |
| CI/CD, Containers & Deployment | 15% |
| Testing & Observability | 10% |
| Demonstration Scenario & Recovery | 10% |
| Security & Operational Hygiene | 5% |
| Documentation & Repository Quality | 5% |
| Presentation & Communication | 5% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

Scale: **4** Exemplary · **3** Proficient · **2** Developing · **1** Beginning.  
Final score = Σ (score × weight) / 100 → reported **/ 4.00**.  
≥ 3.50 Exemplary · 2.50–3.49 Proficient · 1.50–2.49 Developing · &lt; 1.50 Beginning. Below **2.50** does not meet the completion bar.

### 8.4 Scoring rules

1. Demonstration without supporting evidence does **not** receive full credit.  
2. Committed secrets or unsafe unauthorized actions must be **remediated** before assessment.  
3. Final defense score is **part of** the overall Week 6 score (sections 8.1 / 8.3), not a disconnected vanity grade.  
4. Peer review contributes via professionalism marks and evidence quality; it does not replace instructor assessment.  
5. A formal **evidence index** is required before the final presentation (Lab 52).  
6. Security findings and deployment gaps are **hard gates** for full credit unless residual risk is explicitly accepted with owner and date.  
7. Self-score (Lab 52) is reconciled with instructor review using evidence links.  
8. Anchor scores to rubric descriptors, not to other teams; Proficient = competent early-career bar, Exemplary = promotion-credible.
