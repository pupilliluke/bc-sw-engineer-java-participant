---

## How to follow this lab

1. Open the **Windows** or **macOS** how-to (links above) in a second tab.
2. Create/work only under your `java-bootcamp/examples/…` folder from the steps (not inside this `labs/` git clone unless a step says otherwise).
3. For each **Step N**: read **Why** (if present) → do the actions → confirm **Expected** / **Expected result** → then continue.
4. When stuck, use **Failure Experiments** / troubleshooting in this guide before asking for help.
5. Capture evidence under `notes/screenshots/lab-4/` (workspace root under `java-bootcamp`; redact secrets). Use the **Pass criteria** tables — write **Pass** or **Fail** in your notes. GitHub file view does not support clickable checkboxes.

## Lab Overview

This Module 4 lab builds **JVM memory literacy**: stack versus heap, object lifecycle, garbage collection, leak patterns, weak references, heap flags, and laptop-friendly diagnostics (`Runtime` API, GC logs, optional `jstat` / `jconsole` / VisualVM).

**Purpose.** Features without heap awareness become production `OutOfMemoryError` fire drills. Lab 4 trains you to *see* allocation, reachability, and GC recovery on your own machine before you stress a real multi-service stack.

**What you build (exercise).** Flat-package demos under `examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`: `Person`, `MemoryMonitor`, `StackExample`, `HeapExample`, `ObjectLifecycle`, `GarbageCollectionDemo`, `MemoryLeakDemo` (`leak` / `fix`), `WeakReferenceDemo`, `PerformanceTest`, plus optional bonuses (`StringMemoryComparison`, `ListMemoryComparison`, `OutOfMemoryDemo`).

**What success looks like.** You compile with `javac *.java`, run each demo, capture memory reports and GC log snippets, complete an allocation comparison table, explain a leak and its fix, and optionally peek at heap tools—without committing heap dumps that may contain sensitive data.

**Depends on Lab 0.** If VS Code / IntelliJ, `java`, or `javac` fail, fix [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) / [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md).

**CRM connection (future only).** From Lab 8 onward the **Customer Management Platform** will allocate customers, caches, and payloads at scale. This lab does **not** build CRM APIs. Treat it as the memory mental model you will need when a CRM service blows the heap under load.

**Reference solution:** [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/) — flat `.java` demos matching the workspace layout.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Explain **stack** (per-thread frames: primitives + references) versus **heap** (shared objects)
* Trace nested method calls and sketch which locals live in which frame
* Allocate objects on the heap and use `System.identityHashCode()` as an identity hint
* Narrate the object lifecycle: create → use → share references → drop references → GC-eligible
* Allocate large batches of objects, null the root reference, and observe used memory before/after GC
* Monitor heap with `Runtime.getRuntime()` (total / free / used / max)
* Reproduce a **reachable** collection “leak” and recover memory with `clear()` / null + GC
* Compare **strong** vs `WeakReference` behavior after `System.gc()`
* Measure allocation cost with `System.nanoTime()` across object counts
* Enable GC logging (`-Xlog:gc`), tune `-Xms` / `-Xmx`, and optionally use `jstat`, `jconsole`, or VisualVM on the laptop
* Fill a results table and answer reflection questions with evidence-backed wording

---

## Business Scenario

A banking batch job is consuming excessive memory and occasionally crashes with **`OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`**. Mentors want proof you can investigate—not restart blindly.

You need to determine:

* Where locals and objects live (stack vs heap)
* Why used memory keeps rising while GC appears “busy”
* Whether objects remain **reachable** (so GC cannot reclaim them)
* How weak references differ from strong retention
* How heap ergonomics (`-Xms` / `-Xmx`) and GC logs change what you observe
* Which tools on your **laptop** help when you need a second opinion (`jstat`, optional GUI tools)

**Pedagogical frame.** Demos use `Person`, `Employee`, `Student`, and byte payloads—not live customer PII. The skills transfer when a future CRM cache retains every customer forever.

**Security note for evidence.** **Never** paste secrets or full heap dumps into chat/Git. Heap dumps may contain passwords and personal data. Prefer screenshots of memory reports and short GC log snippets.

## Prerequisites

Complete [Labs Setup Instructions](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) and [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md). Confirm:

* **JDK 21** with `javac` and `java` on `PATH`
* **VS Code** and/or **IntelliJ IDEA** on the laptop — see [`_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md`](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md)
* Workspace root open: `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` or `$HOME/java-bootcamp`
* Comfort with Lab 1–style `javac` / `java` on flat `.java` files
* No secrets committed to Git

### Pre-flight

In the IDE terminal (PowerShell, cmd, bash, or zsh):

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

**Expected theme:** OpenJDK / Temurin **21.x**.

**If it fails:** Revisit Lab 0 (`JAVA_HOME`, new terminal after PATH changes).

---

## Steps from the training slides

> Paths below use `$HOME/java-bootcamp` (works in PowerShell as `$HOME`, bash/zsh as `$HOME`, or expand to `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` on classic Windows cmd). Flat demos live in **one folder**—no `src/` package tree.

### Step 1 — Create the Lab 4 workspace

**Why:** A known path under `examples/` matches Lab 0 conventions and keeps grading evidence easy to find.

**Do this:**

**VS Code:** **File → Open Folder…** → open `java-bootcamp` (or open the new lab folder after you create it). Use the integrated terminal.

**IntelliJ:** **File → Open…** → select the project folder once `.java` files exist (or open the parent and navigate). Set **Project SDK = 21**.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
mkdir -p "$HOME/java-bootcamp/notes/screenshots/lab-4"
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
```

Windows cmd equivalent:

```text
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples\Lab4-MemoryManagement
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\notes\screenshots\lab-4
cd /d %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples\Lab4-MemoryManagement
```

**Expected result:** Current directory is `.../examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement` (empty at first).

**If it fails:** Wrong home → print `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%` and recreate under that path. Confusing editor windows → open the folder again per [`_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md`](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md).

---

### Step 2 — Create `Person.java` and `MemoryMonitor.java`

**Why:** Shared model + memory reporting keep every later demo readable and consistent.

**Do this:** Create both files in the Lab4 folder (default package — **no** `package` line).

`Person.java` should hold `name` / `age`, a constructor, getters, and a clear `toString()`.

`MemoryMonitor.java` should offer:

* `printMemoryReport(String label)` using `Runtime.getRuntime()` for total / free / used / max (print MB)
* `triggerGarbageCollection()` calling `System.gc()` (hint only) with a short pause
* Helpers for used bytes / MB conversion

**Expected result:** Files open in the IDE; class names match file names.

**If it fails:** `public class` name ≠ file name → rename. Accidentally adding `package com...` → remove it for this flat lab.

---

### Step 3 — `StackExample` — nested frames

**Why:** Stack frames store primitives and **references**; seeing `main → A → B → C` makes “locals die when methods return” concrete.

**Do this:** Create `StackExample.java` that:

1. Declares locals in `main` (int, String, `Person`)
2. Calls `methodA` → `methodB` → `methodC`
3. Prints frame details (primitive value, reference → object text, `identityHashCode`)

Compile and run:

```bash
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
javac Person.java MemoryMonitor.java StackExample.java
java StackExample
```

**IntelliJ alternate:** Right-click `StackExample` → **Run ‘StackExample.main()’** after SDK 21 is set.

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Stack Memory Demonstration =====
Call chain: main() -> methodA() -> methodB() -> methodC()

main() frame
  Primitive on stack : mainCounter = 1
  ...
methodA() frame
...
methodC() frame
...
Back in main() - methodC() frame has been removed from the stack.
```

**If it fails:** `cannot find symbol: Person` → compile `Person.java` in the same folder first (`javac *.java` is simplest).

---

### Step 4 — `HeapExample` — objects live on the heap

**Why:** Multiple object types with printed identity hashes prove references (stack) ≠ objects (heap).

**Do this:** Create `HeapExample.java` that:

1. Prints a memory report **before** allocation
2. Creates several small objects (`Student`, `Employee`, `Customer`, `Book` as nested/static classes is fine)
3. Prints each reference name, `toString()`, and `identityHashCode`
4. Prints a memory report **after** allocation

```bash
javac *.java
java HeapExample
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Heap Memory Demonstration =====
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Allocation =====
Total Memory : ... MB
...
Objects created on the heap:
Reference (stack) : student
Object (heap)     : Student{name='John'}
Identity hash     : <number>
...
===== JVM Memory Report: After Allocation =====
Observation:
- References (...) live on the stack
- Actual objects live on the heap
```

Exact MB numbers vary by JDK and OS—that is normal.

**If it fails:** Only `Before` report prints → check that object creation and `printObjectInfo` are not inside a branch you never enter.

---

### Step 5 — `ObjectLifecycle` — create → use → null → eligible

**Why:** GC eligibility is about **reachability**, not “old objects.”

**Do this:** Create `ObjectLifecycle.java` that walks five narrative steps:

1. Create a `Person`
2. Use getters
3. Alias with a second reference (same identity hash)
4. Set both references to `null`
5. Call `MemoryMonitor.triggerGarbageCollection()` and print before/after reports

```bash
java ObjectLifecycle
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Object Lifecycle Demonstration =====
Step 1: Create object
Created -> ...
Step 3: Hold reference
secondReference points to same object : true
Step 4: Remove references
... object is now unreachable
Step 5: Eligible for Garbage Collection
===== JVM Memory Report: Before GC =====
...
An object becomes eligible for GC when no live thread can reach it.
```

**If it fails:** Used memory “does not drop” for one tiny object → expected; the point is the reachability story, not a dramatic MB cliff.

---

### Step 6 — `GarbageCollectionDemo` — allocate, null, observe

**Why:** A large batch makes Before / After Allocation / After GC reports easier to read than one object.

**Do this:** Create `GarbageCollectionDemo.java` that:

1. Allocates an array of ~**100,000** demo objects (each may hold a small `byte[]` payload)
2. Prints object count + memory report after allocation
3. Sets the array reference to `null`
4. Triggers GC and prints an After GC report + elapsed ms tip for logging

```bash
java GarbageCollectionDemo
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Garbage Collection Demonstration =====
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Allocation =====
...
Creating Objects...
Objects Created : 100000
===== JVM Memory Report: After Allocation =====
...
Removing strong references...
Triggering Garbage Collection...
Garbage Collection Completed
===== JVM Memory Report: After GC =====
Execution Time : ... ms
Tip: Run with GC logging using:
java -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
```

**If it fails:** `OutOfMemoryError` during allocation → close other heavy apps; retry with a larger heap temporarily:  
`java -Xmx512m GarbageCollectionDemo`.

---

### Step 7 — GC logging (`-Xlog:gc`)

**Why:** Application prints show *your* labels; GC logs show what the **collector** did.

**Do this:**

```bash
java -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
```

Save a short snippet into `../../notes/lab4-gc-snippet.txt` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-gc-snippet.txt`) (a few lines are enough).

**Expected result (pattern themes — exact text varies by JDK):**

```text
[0.xxxs][info][gc] Using G1
...
[0.xxxs][info][gc] GC(0) Pause Young (Normal) ...
...
===== Garbage Collection Demonstration =====
...
```

You should see:

* A collector name line (often G1 on modern JDKs)
* One or more `GC(...)` pause / collection lines interleaved with your demo output
* Your `After GC` memory report still appearing

**If it fails:** `-Xlog:gc` unknown → confirm `java -version` is **21**, not a very old JDK 8 that uses `-XX:+PrintGC` differently. No GC lines at all → allocation may be too small for visible pauses; keep the 100k demo.

---

### Step 8 — `MemoryLeakDemo` — `leak` vs `fix`

**Why:** The classic “bug” is **reachable** retention (static/list holder), not a broken GC.

**Do this:** Create `MemoryLeakDemo.java` with two modes:

* `leak` — keep adding many `Employee`-like objects into a **static** / long-lived list; print memory every 100k adds; never clear
* `fix` — allocate into a **local** list, `clear()`, null the reference, trigger GC, show used memory drop theme

```bash
java MemoryLeakDemo leak
# stop with Ctrl+C after a few progress lines if it runs long

java MemoryLeakDemo fix
```

**Expected result — leak (themes):**

```text
===== Memory Leak Demonstration =====
Adding employees to a static list that is never cleared...
Added 100000 employees
===== JVM Memory Report: After 100000 Objects =====
...
Observation:
- Memory keeps increasing because objects remain reachable
- GC cannot collect objects that are still referenced
```

**Expected result — fix (themes):**

```text
===== Memory Leak Fix Demonstration =====
...
Clearing list to remove strong references...
Triggering Garbage Collection...
===== JVM Memory Report: After GC =====
Observation:
- Clearing the list removes references ...
- Used memory drops after GC
```

**If it fails:** Machine thrashing on leak mode → stop early; you only need **evidence of rising used memory**, not a full million objects. Forgetting CLI arg → expect a `Usage:` message for `leak` / `fix`.

---

### Step 9 — `WeakReferenceDemo`

**Why:** Caches and listeners often should not pin objects forever; weak refs teach that pattern.

**Do this:** Create `WeakReferenceDemo.java` that:

1. Keeps a strong `Person`, calls GC, shows the object still prints
2. Wraps another `Person` in `WeakReference`, nulls the strong local, triggers GC, prints `weakReference.get()` (often `null`)

```bash
java WeakReferenceDemo
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Weak Reference Demonstration =====
--- Strong Reference ---
Before GC : ...
After GC  : ...
Object remains because a strong reference still exists.

--- Weak Reference ---
Before removing strong reference : ...
Strong reference removed.
After GC via WeakReference.get() : null   # or still present if GC did not run yet
Observation:
- WeakReference allows GC to collect the object when only weak refs remain
```

**If it fails:** Weak target still non-null after GC → `System.gc()` is a **hint**; re-run or accept “may be collected” wording in notes. Still correct conceptually if you null only the strong reference.

---

### Step 10 — `PerformanceTest` + results table

**Why:** Timing + memory deltas train evidence habits before APM tools appear.

**Do this:** Create `PerformanceTest.java` that allocates for counts such as `{10, 100, 1000, 100000, 1000000}`, prints a table of Objects / Used Memory / Execution Time, and includes a few extra micro-measurements (loop, large array, ~10 MB `byte[]`).

```bash
java -Xms128m -Xmx512m PerformanceTest
```

Copy results into `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`):

| Objects | Used Memory (approx) | Execution Time |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 10 | | |
| 100 | | |
| 1,000 | | |
| 100,000 | | |
| 1,000,000 | | |

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Performance Measurement =====
Objects      Used Memory    Execution Time
--------------------------------------------------
10           ... MB         ... ms
100          ...
...
Additional measurements:
Loop execution (10M iterations) : ... ms | sum = ...
int[1,000,000] allocation       : ... ms
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Large byte[] =====
...
```

Numbers differ by machine—record **your** run.

**If it fails:** OOM at 1,000,000 → raise `-Xmx` modestly or skip the largest row and note it. Never leave an unbounded allocator running overnight.

---

### Step 11 — Optional laptop tools (`jstat`, `jconsole`, VisualVM)

**Why:** The `Runtime` API is enough for the rubric; CLI/GUI tools deepen intuition on **your** OS desktop.

**Do this (pick what you have time for):**

1. **`jstat` (CLI)** — in one terminal start a longish demo; in another:

```bash
jps
# note the PID of your demo
jstat -gc <PID> 1000 5
```

2. **`jconsole` (optional GUI)** — run `jconsole`, attach to a running demo, glance at Memory / Memory Pool charts.

3. **VisualVM (optional)** — if installed, attach and watch heap over time while `GarbageCollectionDemo` or `leak` mode runs briefly.

**Heap dump (optional, careful):**

```bash
# Prefer OS temp — do NOT commit .hprof files
# Windows PowerShell example:
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file="$env:TEMP/lab4-heap.hprof" <PID>

# macOS / Linux example:
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=/tmp/lab4-heap.hprof <PID>
```

Delete dumps after a quick look. Never zip them into LMS submissions.

**Expected result:** Either tool charts / counters move while allocations run, **or** you document “skipped optional GUI; GC logs + Runtime reports used instead.”

**If it fails:** `jps` empty → run the Java demo first. Firewall / permission pop-ups on Windows → allow for local attach only. No VisualVM → skip; not required for core marks.

---

### Step 12 — Reflect and self-check

**Why:** Graders score explanations (reachability, leak cause) as much as runnable demos.

**Do this:** In `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`), answer the [Reflection Questions](#reflection-questions) briefly and attach:

* Screenshot(s) of memory reports
* Short GC log snippet
* Completed performance table
* One paragraph: how `leak` differs from `fix`

Optionally skim [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/) *after* your attempt.

**Expected result:** Notes a grader can re-run and understand without opening a dump file.

**If it fails:** Missing evidence → re-run Steps 6–10 and capture terminal output only.

### Programs map

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `MemoryMonitor.java` | Shared heap reports + GC hint |
| `Person.java` | Simple model |
| `StackExample.java` | Nested frames |
| `HeapExample.java` | Allocation + identity hashes |

| ---- | ---- |
| `-Xlog:gc` | GC event stream |
| `-Xms` / `-Xmx` | Initial / max heap |
| `-Xms32m -Xmx64m` | Tiny heap for intentional OOM bonus |

Maven is **not** required for this lab.

---

## Manual Verification

1. `javac *.java` succeeds with no errors.
2. `StackExample` shows nested frames and return to `main`.
3. `HeapExample` prints distinct identity hashes for different objects.
4. `GarbageCollectionDemo` shows After Allocation used memory ≥ Before; After GC often lower (not guaranteed for tiny leftovers).
5. `-Xlog:gc` includes collector / `GC(...)` style lines.
6. `MemoryLeakDemo leak` rises; `fix` recovers after clear + GC theme.
7. `PerformanceTest` table has five object-count rows.

Record pass/fail briefly in `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`).

---

## Failure Experiments

1. Null only one alias in `ObjectLifecycle` → object may stay reachable.  
2. Call GC without nulling the 100k array → used memory stays high (reachability beats hints).  
3. Grow forever without tiny `-Xmx` → thrash; use `-Xmx64m` + catch for OOM bonus only.  
4. Create a dump under `%TEMP%` or `/tmp` → delete it; never commit `.hprof`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| `javac` / `java` not found | PATH / JAVA_HOME | Lab 0; new terminal |
| `cannot find symbol` | Missing compile of helper | `javac *.java` in lab folder |
| Identity hashes look equal | Same object aliased | Expected when two refs point to one object |
| GC log empty | Wrong flag / old JDK | Use JDK 21 `-Xlog:gc` |
| Leak does not OOM | GC + OS headroom | Rising used MB is enough evidence |
| Weak ref still non-null | GC did not run | Re-run; document “hint only” |
| IntelliJ wrong SDK | Project SDK ≠ 21 | Project Structure → SDK 21 |
| VS Code terminal wrong cwd | Opened parent only | `cd` into `Lab4-MemoryManagement` |

---

## Security, Cleanup, and Deliverables

**Security:** Never commit `.hprof` or paste dump contents (PII risk). Keep OOM runs short with tiny `-Xmx`. Prefer fixing retention over sprinkling `System.gc()` in production-style code.

**Cleanup:**

```bash
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
rm -f *.class *.hprof
rm -f /tmp/lab4-heap.hprof
# PowerShell: Remove-Item *.class, *.hprof -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
#            Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\lab4-heap.hprof" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Keep `.java` sources and notes. Leave [`solution/`](solution/) intact.

**Deliverables:** core demos; memory/GC screenshots; `-Xlog:gc` snippet; performance table; `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`); LMS overview (tools + leak cause/fix). No dumps, secrets, or verbatim solution copies.

## Bonus Challenges

Align with [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/):

1. **`StringMemoryComparison`** — `String +=` vs `StringBuilder` timing/memory  
2. **`ListMemoryComparison`** — `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList` memory  
3. **`OutOfMemoryDemo`** — `java -Xms32m -Xmx64m OutOfMemoryDemo` (catch, then stop)  
4. Optional VisualVM/MAT on a dump under `%TEMP%` or `/tmp`, then **delete** the dump

## Instructor Notes

Solution demos live in [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/). Score reachability narrative, `leak`/`fix`, GC snippet, and performance table. Dual IDE on laptop; optional `jstat` / `jconsole` / VisualVM. Pitfalls: un-nulled aliases, trusting `System.gc()` for tiny objects, committing `.hprof`.
