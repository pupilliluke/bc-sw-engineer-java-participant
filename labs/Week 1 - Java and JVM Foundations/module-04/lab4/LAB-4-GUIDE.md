# Lab 4: Memory Management and Garbage Collection

> **Participants:** Module sequence is in [`../README.md`](../README.md). **Do not start this guide until** you have finished Module 4 [pre-lab exercises 1–7](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) (Pass in your notes). Exercises run on Day 3; this graded lab is Day 4. Day 3 “Lab 4 briefing” is folder/notes prep only — not GUIDE Steps. Then open **one** OS how-to ([Windows](LAB-4-WINDOWS.md) · [macOS](LAB-4-MACOS.md)). In class, prefer the **45-minute timed path** with [`starter/`](starter/README.md); the **full path** is every Step below (homework / extended). Skip `solution/` unless your instructor says otherwise. See [Which file do I open?](../../../_PARTICIPANT-FILE-GUIDE.md).

**Module:** 4 — Memory Management and Performance  
**Lab folder:** `labs/Week 1 - Java and JVM Foundations/module-04/lab4/`  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate (Beginner-Friendly)  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes (timed path with starter) · Full path: 60–240 minutes (Day 4 core checkpoint ~60 min; finish remaining demos/tools as extended work)

**Primary IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition · **Optional IDE:** VS Code

| OS | How-to for this lab |
| -- | ------------------- |
| Windows | [LAB-4-WINDOWS.md](LAB-4-WINDOWS.md) |
| macOS | [LAB-4-MACOS.md](LAB-4-MACOS.md) |

> **Environment reminder:** Finish [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md). Use **JDK 21** and **IntelliJ IDEA Community** (primary) or **VS Code** (optional). Workspace: `java-bootcamp` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp`).

> **Hard gate — pre-lab exercises:** Complete **all seven** Module 4 exercises under [`../exercises/`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) and mark their Pass criteria **Pass** **before** Step 1 of this lab. Lab 4 is graded consolidation in a **separate** flat folder (`examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`), not a replacement for the exercises folder (`examples/module-04-exercises/`).

## 45-minute timed path (use starter)

In class, use the starter templates so the **core** objectives fit **~45 minutes**. The full Steps below remain for homework / extended depth.

1. Open [`starter/README.md`](starter/README.md).
2. Copy `starter/Lab4-MemoryManagement/` into your `java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/` target folder (commands in the starter README).
3. Fill every `// TODO` / `_____` — do **not** open `solution/` first.
4. Run the starter smoke test; capture evidence under `notes/screenshots/lab-4/`.
5. Mark the **timed-path Pass criteria** in the starter README. Continue remaining GUIDE steps only if time allows (or as homework).

| Path | Time | Scope |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| **Timed (default)** | ~45 min | Starter TODOs + smoke test |
| **Full (extended)** | see Duration | Every Step in this GUIDE |

**Verified participant layout (Windows IntelliJ + PowerShell; Temurin JDK 21.0.11):**

| Role | Path |
| ---- | ---- |
| IntelliJ opens | `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` (SDK / language level **21**) |
| Pre-lab exercises | `examples\module-04-exercises\` (flat files — must exist before graded work) |
| This lab folder | `examples\Lab4-MemoryManagement\` (flat `.java` — **no** Sources Root / packages) |
| Compile | Named `javac` of the nine core demos in that folder |
| Useful VM flags | `-Xms16m -Xmx64m -Xlog:gc` for `GarbageCollectionDemo`; `-Xms128m -Xmx512m` for `PerformanceTest` |
| Smoke-test themes | Nested stack frames; heap identity hashes; GC reclaim after null; G1 log lines; leak rise / fix drop; weak `get()` → `null` |

**If it fails (Windows PowerShell):** Name each `.java` file in the `javac` line (see [LAB-4-WINDOWS.md](LAB-4-WINDOWS.md)). Do **not** mark this folder as Sources Root (unlike Labs 2–3). If `OutOfMemoryError` on GC demo, raise `-Xmx` temporarily or close heavy apps.

---

## How to follow this lab

1. **In class:** prefer the [45-minute timed path](#45-minute-timed-path-use-starter) with [`starter/`](starter/README.md).
2. Confirm Lab 0 + Module 4 Exercises 1–7 are done (checklists below). Bring your Exercise 4–5 G1/ZGC notes for the Day 4 compare checkpoint.
3. Open the **Windows** or **macOS** how-to (links above) in a second tab.
4. Create/work only under your `java-bootcamp/examples/…` folder from the steps (not inside this `labs/` git clone unless a step says otherwise).
5. For each **Step N**: read **Why** / **Builds on** (if present) → do the actions → confirm **Expected** / **Expected result** → then continue.
6. When stuck, use **Failure Experiments** / troubleshooting in this guide before asking for help.
7. Capture evidence under `notes/screenshots/lab-4/` (workspace root under `java-bootcamp`; redact secrets). Use the **Pass criteria** tables — write **Pass** or **Fail** in your notes. GitHub file view does not support clickable checkboxes.

## What you'll submit (read this first)

Keep this checklist visible while you work. Full detail is under [Expected Deliverables](#expected-deliverables) at the end.

| # | Deliverable | Where / what |
| - | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1 | Core demos (source) | `examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/` — stack/heap, lifecycle, GC, leak, performance demos |
| 2 | Screenshots | `notes/screenshots/lab-4/` — memory/GC runs; `-Xlog:gc` snippet; performance table |
| 3 | Short answers | `notes/lab4-answers.md` (reflection questions) |
| 4 | LMS overview | Tools used + leak cause/fix in your own words |

Do **not** submit heap dumps (`.hprof`), secrets, or a verbatim instructor `solution/`.


## Module 4 exercises you must already have completed

Lab 4 assumes you already practiced these runtime skills in `examples/module-04-exercises/`. Do **not** treat Steps 3–8 as your first time seeing stack/heap, lifecycle, GC logs, or retention.

| Exercise | You already did | Lab 4 builds on it |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 — Stack vs Heap | `StackHeapDemo` — locals/refs vs heap | Steps 3–4 (`StackExample`, `HeapExample`) |
| 2 — Object Lifecycle | Aliases → null → eligible | Step 5 (`ObjectLifecycle`) |
| 3 — GC Observe | Bounded allocate + `-Xlog:gc` | Steps 6–7 (`GarbageCollectionDemo` + GC log) |
| 4 — G1 Flag | Re-run with `-XX:+UseG1GC` | Day 4 compare checkpoint; Step 7 often shows G1 implicitly |
| 5 — ZGC Flag | Re-run with `-XX:+UseZGC`; contrast Ex 4 | Day 4 compare (reuse Ex notes; optional lab re-run) |
| 6 — Retention Sketch | Static cache + `clear()` | Step 8 (`MemoryLeakDemo` leak/fix) |
| 7 — String vs StringBuilder | Concat vs builder timing | Lab **bonus** `StringMemoryComparison` |

**Intentional deltas (extend — do not paste exercise code blindly):**

* Exercises are smaller/bounded demos; Lab uses shared `Person` + `MemoryMonitor` and larger batch sizes for clearer reports
* Keep exercise and lab folders separate (both flat, different names)
* Exercise G1/ZGC evidence counts for the Day 4 “compare collectors” checkpoint — bring those notes

**Lab-only additions:** `Person` / `MemoryMonitor`, `WeakReferenceDemo`, `PerformanceTest` + results table, optional `jstat`/`jconsole`/VisualVM, bonus OOM/`ListMemoryComparison`

If any of Exercises 1–7 is still **Fail**, finish that exercise first — then return here.

---

## Lab Overview

This Module 4 lab is the **graded consolidation** after Module 4 slides and [Exercises 1–7](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md). You already practiced stack/heap, lifecycle, GC observation, G1/ZGC flags, retention, and StringBuilder cost in `module-04-exercises/`. Here you assemble those skills into a **shared-monitor demo suite** with leak/fix, weak references, performance table, and optional laptop tools.

**Purpose.** Features without heap awareness become production `OutOfMemoryError` fire drills. Lab 4 locks the mental model: allocation, reachability, and GC recovery on your own machine—with submit-ready evidence—before you stress a real multi-service stack.

**What you build.** Flat-package demos under `examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`: `Person`, `MemoryMonitor`, `StackExample`, `HeapExample`, `ObjectLifecycle`, `GarbageCollectionDemo`, `MemoryLeakDemo` (`leak` / `fix`), `WeakReferenceDemo`, `PerformanceTest`, plus optional bonuses (`StringMemoryComparison`, `ListMemoryComparison`, `OutOfMemoryDemo`).

**What success looks like.** You compile with `javac *.java`, run each demo, capture memory reports and GC log snippets, complete an allocation comparison table, explain a leak and its fix, and optionally peek at heap tools—without committing heap dumps that may contain sensitive data. Exercise sources remain under `examples/module-04-exercises/`.

**Depends on Lab 0 + Exercises 1–7.** If VS Code / IntelliJ, `java`, or `javac` fail, fix [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) / [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md). If exercises are incomplete, open [`../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md).

**CRM connection (future only).** From Lab 8 onward the **Customer Management Platform** will allocate customers, caches, and payloads at scale. This lab does **not** build CRM APIs. Treat it as the memory mental model you will need when a CRM service blows the heap under load.

**Reference solution:** [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/) — flat `.java` demos matching the workspace layout.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to **consolidate and extend** what you practiced in Exercises 1–7:

* Explain **stack** (per-thread frames: primitives + references) versus **heap** (shared objects) with graded demos (builds on Exercise 1)
* Trace nested method calls and sketch which locals live in which frame
* Allocate objects on the heap and use `System.identityHashCode()` as an identity hint
* Narrate the object lifecycle: create → use → share references → drop references → GC-eligible (builds on Exercise 2)
* Allocate large batches, null the root, and observe used memory before/after GC with shared `MemoryMonitor` (builds on Exercise 3)
* Enable GC logging (`-Xlog:gc`), tune `-Xms` / `-Xmx`, and compare G1/ZGC evidence from Exercises 4–5
* Reproduce a **reachable** collection “leak” and recover memory with `clear()` / null + GC (builds on Exercise 6)
* Compare **strong** vs `WeakReference` behavior after `System.gc()` (**lab-only** depth)
* Measure allocation cost with `System.nanoTime()` across object counts (**lab-only** depth)
* Optionally use `jstat`, `jconsole`, or VisualVM on the laptop
* Fill a results table and answer reflection questions with evidence-backed wording
* Extend Exercise 7 habits into the optional `StringMemoryComparison` bonus

---

## Business Scenario

A banking batch job is consuming excessive memory and occasionally crashes with **`OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`**. Mentors want proof you can investigate—not restart blindly.

You already practiced the runtime building blocks in Module 4 Exercises 1–7. Today’s **graded** pass consolidates those skills into a shared-monitor demo suite (pedagogical types — not live CRM PII).

You need to determine:

* Where locals and objects live (stack vs heap)
* Why used memory keeps rising while GC appears “busy”
* Whether objects remain **reachable** (so GC cannot reclaim them)
* How weak references differ from strong retention
* How heap ergonomics (`-Xms` / `-Xmx`) and GC logs change what you observe
* Which tools on your **laptop** help when you need a second opinion (`jstat`, optional GUI tools)

**Pedagogical frame.** Demos use `Person`, `Employee`, `Student`, and byte payloads—not live customer PII. The skills transfer when a future CRM cache retains every customer forever.

**Security note for evidence.** **Never** paste secrets or full heap dumps into chat/Git. Heap dumps may contain passwords and personal data. Prefer screenshots of memory reports and short GC log snippets.

## Prerequisites

Complete **both** of the following before Step 1:

1. [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) / [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) and [`_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md`](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md)
2. Module 4 [Exercises 1–7](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) — all Pass rows marked **Pass**

Confirm:

* **JDK 21** with `javac` and `java` on `PATH`
* **VS Code** and/or **IntelliJ IDEA** on the laptop
* Workspace root open: `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` or `$HOME/java-bootcamp`
* Comfort with Lab 1–style `javac` / `java` on flat `.java` files
* `examples/module-04-exercises/` has your Exercise 1–7 work
* No secrets committed to Git

Confirm exercise readiness (from your notes / `module-04-exercises/`):

| # | Exercise skill | Ready? |
| - | -------------- | ------ |
| 1 | Stack locals/refs vs heap objects sketched | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | Lifecycle: aliases → null → GC-eligible explained | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | Bounded GC run with `-Xlog:gc` evidence | Pass / Fail |
| 4–5 | G1 and ZGC flag runs compared at a high level | Pass / Fail |
| 6 | Retention root identified and cleared | Pass / Fail |
| 7 | String vs StringBuilder trend noted | Pass / Fail |

If any row is **Fail**, finish that exercise before continuing.

### Pre-flight

In the IDE terminal (PowerShell, cmd, bash, or zsh):

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

**Windows PowerShell also:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\module-04-exercises
```

**macOS / Linux also:**

```bash
ls ~/java-bootcamp/examples/module-04-exercises
```

**Expected theme:** OpenJDK / Temurin **21.x**; exercise sources present.

**If it fails:** Revisit Lab 0 (`JAVA_HOME`, new terminal after PATH changes). If exercises are missing, return to [`../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md).

---

## Steps from the training slides

> Paths below use `$HOME/java-bootcamp` (works in PowerShell as `$HOME`, bash/zsh as `$HOME`, or expand to `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` on classic Windows cmd). Flat demos live in **one folder**—no `src/` package tree.

### Step 1 — Create the Lab 4 workspace

**Why:** A known path under `examples/` matches Lab 0 conventions and keeps grading evidence easy to find.

**Builds on:** Exercises used `module-04-exercises/`. This graded folder is separate — do not overwrite exercise sources.

**Do this:**

**VS Code:** **File → Open Folder…** → open `java-bootcamp` (or open the new lab folder after you create it). Use the integrated terminal.

**IntelliJ:** **File → Open…** → select the project folder once `.java` files exist (or open the parent and navigate). Set **Project SDK = 21**.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
mkdir -p "$HOME/java-bootcamp/notes/screenshots/lab-4"
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
```

Windows cmd equivalent:

```text
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples\Lab4-MemoryManagement
mkdir %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\notes\screenshots\lab-4
cd /d %USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples\Lab4-MemoryManagement
```

**Expected result:** Current directory is `.../examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement` (empty at first).

**If it fails:** Wrong home → print `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%` and recreate under that path. Confusing editor windows → open the folder again per [`_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md`](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md).

---

### Step 2 — Create `Person.java` and `MemoryMonitor.java`

**Why:** Shared model + memory reporting keep every later demo readable and consistent.

**Lab-only foundation:** Exercises used one-off demos; Lab shares `Person` + `MemoryMonitor` across programs.

**Do this:** Create both files in the Lab4 folder (default package — **no** `package` line).

`Person.java` should hold `name` / `age`, a constructor, getters, and a clear `toString()`.

`MemoryMonitor.java` should offer:

* `printMemoryReport(String label)` using `Runtime.getRuntime()` for total / free / used / max (print MB)
* `triggerGarbageCollection()` calling `System.gc()` (hint only) with a short pause
* Helpers for used bytes / MB conversion

**Expected result:** Files open in the IDE; class names match file names.

**If it fails:** `public class` name ≠ file name → rename. Accidentally adding `package com...` → remove it for this flat lab.

---

### Step 3 — `StackExample` — nested frames

**Why:** Stack frames store primitives and **references**; seeing `main → A → B → C` makes “locals die when methods return” concrete.

**Builds on Exercise 1:** Same stack-vs-heap story — graded nested-frame walkthrough.

**Do this:** Create `StackExample.java` that:

1. Declares locals in `main` (int, String, `Person`)
2. Calls `methodA` → `methodB` → `methodC`
3. Prints frame details (primitive value, reference → object text, `identityHashCode`)

Compile and run:

```bash
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
javac Person.java MemoryMonitor.java StackExample.java
java StackExample
```

**IntelliJ alternate:** Right-click `StackExample` → **Run ‘StackExample.main()’** after SDK 21 is set.

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Stack Memory Demonstration =====
Call chain: main() -> methodA() -> methodB() -> methodC()

main() frame
  Primitive on stack : mainCounter = 1
  ...
methodA() frame
...
methodC() frame
...
Back in main() - methodC() frame has been removed from the stack.
```

**If it fails:** `cannot find symbol: Person` → compile `Person.java` in the same folder first (`javac *.java` is simplest).

---

### Step 4 — `HeapExample` — objects live on the heap

**Why:** Multiple object types with printed identity hashes prove references (stack) ≠ objects (heap).

**Builds on Exercise 1:** Same heap identity idea — graded multi-object demo with `identityHashCode`.

**Do this:** Create `HeapExample.java` that:

1. Prints a memory report **before** allocation
2. Creates several small objects (`Student`, `Employee`, `Customer`, `Book` as nested/static classes is fine)
3. Prints each reference name, `toString()`, and `identityHashCode`
4. Prints a memory report **after** allocation

```bash
javac *.java
java HeapExample
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Heap Memory Demonstration =====
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Allocation =====
Total Memory : ... MB
...
Objects created on the heap:
Reference (stack) : student
Object (heap)     : Student{name='John'}
Identity hash     : <number>
...
===== JVM Memory Report: After Allocation =====
Observation:
- References (...) live on the stack
- Actual objects live on the heap
```

Exact MB numbers vary by JDK and OS—that is normal.

**If it fails:** Only `Before` report prints → check that object creation and `printObjectInfo` are not inside a branch you never enter.

---

### Step 5 — `ObjectLifecycle` — create → use → null → eligible

**Why:** GC eligibility is about **reachability**, not “old objects.”

**Builds on Exercise 2:** Same create → alias → null → eligible narrative with Lab’s `Person` / monitor.

**Do this:** Create `ObjectLifecycle.java` that walks five narrative steps:

1. Create a `Person`
2. Use getters
3. Alias with a second reference (same identity hash)
4. Set both references to `null`
5. Call `MemoryMonitor.triggerGarbageCollection()` and print before/after reports

```bash
java ObjectLifecycle
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Object Lifecycle Demonstration =====
Step 1: Create object
Created -> ...
Step 3: Hold reference
secondReference points to same object : true
Step 4: Remove references
... object is now unreachable
Step 5: Eligible for Garbage Collection
===== JVM Memory Report: Before GC =====
...
An object becomes eligible for GC when no live thread can reach it.
```

**If it fails:** Used memory “does not drop” for one tiny object → expected; the point is the reachability story, not a dramatic MB cliff.

---

### Step 6 — `GarbageCollectionDemo` — allocate, null, observe

**Why:** A large batch makes Before / After Allocation / After GC reports easier to read than one object.

**Builds on Exercise 3:** Same bounded allocate → null → observe pattern; Lab batch may be larger for clearer reports — stay within guide counts.

**Do this:** Create `GarbageCollectionDemo.java` that:

1. Allocates an array of ~**100,000** demo objects (each may hold a small `byte[]` payload)
2. Prints object count + memory report after allocation
3. Sets the array reference to `null`
4. Triggers GC and prints an After GC report + elapsed ms tip for logging

```bash
java GarbageCollectionDemo
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Garbage Collection Demonstration =====
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Allocation =====
...
Creating Objects...
Objects Created : 100000
===== JVM Memory Report: After Allocation =====
...
Removing strong references...
Triggering Garbage Collection...
Garbage Collection Completed
===== JVM Memory Report: After GC =====
Execution Time : ... ms
Tip: Run with GC logging using:
java -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
```

**If it fails:** `OutOfMemoryError` during allocation → close other heavy apps; retry with a larger heap temporarily:  
`java -Xmx512m GarbageCollectionDemo`.

---

### Step 7 — GC logging (`-Xlog:gc`)

**Why:** Application prints show *your* labels; GC logs show what the **collector** did.

**Builds on Exercises 3–5:** Reuse `-Xlog:gc` habit; bring Exercise 4–5 G1/ZGC notes for the Day 4 collector compare.

**Do this:**

```bash
java -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
```

**Windows PowerShell tip (verified clearer GC lines with a small heap):**

```powershell
java -Xms16m -Xmx64m -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
```

Save a short snippet into `../../notes/lab4-gc-snippet.txt` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-gc-snippet.txt`) (a few lines are enough).

**Expected result (pattern themes — exact text varies by JDK):**

```text
[0.xxxs][info][gc] Using G1
...
[0.xxxs][info][gc] GC(0) Pause Young (Normal) ...
...
===== Garbage Collection Demonstration =====
...
```

You should see:

* A collector name line (often G1 on modern JDKs)
* One or more `GC(...)` pause / collection lines interleaved with your demo output
* Your `After GC` memory report still appearing

**If it fails:** `-Xlog:gc` unknown → confirm `java -version` is **21**, not a very old JDK 8 that uses `-XX:+PrintGC` differently. No GC lines at all → allocation may be too small for visible pauses; keep the 100k demo.

---

### Step 8 — `MemoryLeakDemo` — `leak` vs `fix`

**Why:** The classic “bug” is **reachable** retention (static/list holder), not a broken GC.

**Builds on Exercise 6:** Same retention-root idea — graded `leak` / `fix` modes with clear evidence.

**Do this:** Create `MemoryLeakDemo.java` with two modes:

* `leak` — keep adding many `Employee`-like objects into a **static** / long-lived list; print memory every 100k adds; never clear
* `fix` — allocate into a **local** list, `clear()`, null the reference, trigger GC, show used memory drop theme

```bash
java MemoryLeakDemo leak
# stop with Ctrl+C after a few progress lines if it runs long

java MemoryLeakDemo fix
```

**Expected result — leak (themes):**

```text
===== Memory Leak Demonstration =====
Adding employees to a static list that is never cleared...
Added 100000 employees
===== JVM Memory Report: After 100000 Objects =====
...
Observation:
- Memory keeps increasing because objects remain reachable
- GC cannot collect objects that are still referenced
```

**Expected result — fix (themes):**

```text
===== Memory Leak Fix Demonstration =====
...
Clearing list to remove strong references...
Triggering Garbage Collection...
===== JVM Memory Report: After GC =====
Observation:
- Clearing the list removes references ...
- Used memory drops after GC
```

**If it fails:** Machine thrashing on leak mode → stop early; you only need **evidence of rising used memory**, not a full million objects. Forgetting CLI arg → expect a `Usage:` message for `leak` / `fix`.

---

### Step 9 — `WeakReferenceDemo`

**Why:** Caches and listeners often should not pin objects forever; weak refs teach that pattern.

**Lab-only depth:** Not covered as a Module 4 exercise — new consolidation after retention (Exercise 6 / Step 8).

**Do this:** Create `WeakReferenceDemo.java` that:

1. Keeps a strong `Person`, calls GC, shows the object still prints
2. Wraps another `Person` in `WeakReference`, nulls the strong local, triggers GC, prints `weakReference.get()` (often `null`)

```bash
java WeakReferenceDemo
```

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Weak Reference Demonstration =====
--- Strong Reference ---
Before GC : ...
After GC  : ...
Object remains because a strong reference still exists.

--- Weak Reference ---
Before removing strong reference : ...
Strong reference removed.
After GC via WeakReference.get() : null   # or still present if GC did not run yet
Observation:
- WeakReference allows GC to collect the object when only weak refs remain
```

**If it fails:** Weak target still non-null after GC → `System.gc()` is a **hint**; re-run or accept “may be collected” wording in notes. Still correct conceptually if you null only the strong reference.

---

### Step 10 — `PerformanceTest` + results table

**Why:** Timing + memory deltas train evidence habits before APM tools appear.

**Lab-only depth:** Builds measurement habits; Exercise 7 StringBuilder timing is related practice for the optional string bonus.

**Do this:** Create `PerformanceTest.java` that allocates for counts such as `{10, 100, 1000, 100000, 1000000}`, prints a table of Objects / Used Memory / Execution Time, and includes a few extra micro-measurements (loop, large array, ~10 MB `byte[]`).

```bash
java -Xms128m -Xmx512m PerformanceTest
```

Copy results into `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`):

| Objects | Used Memory (approx) | Execution Time |
| ------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| 10 | | |
| 100 | | |
| 1,000 | | |
| 100,000 | | |
| 1,000,000 | | |

**Expected result (themes):**

```text
===== Performance Measurement =====
Objects      Used Memory    Execution Time
--------------------------------------------------
10           ... MB         ... ms
100          ...
...
Additional measurements:
Loop execution (10M iterations) : ... ms | sum = ...
int[1,000,000] allocation       : ... ms
===== JVM Memory Report: Before Large byte[] =====
...
```

Numbers differ by machine—record **your** run.

**If it fails:** OOM at 1,000,000 → raise `-Xmx` modestly or skip the largest row and note it. Never leave an unbounded allocator running overnight.

---

### Step 11 — Optional laptop tools (`jstat`, `jconsole`, VisualVM)

**Why:** The `Runtime` API is enough for the rubric; CLI/GUI tools deepen intuition on **your** OS desktop.

**Do this (pick what you have time for):**

1. **`jstat` (CLI)** — in one terminal start a longish demo; in another:

```bash
jps
# note the PID of your demo
jstat -gc <PID> 1000 5
```

2. **`jconsole` (optional GUI)** — run `jconsole`, attach to a running demo, glance at Memory / Memory Pool charts.

3. **VisualVM (optional)** — if installed, attach and watch heap over time while `GarbageCollectionDemo` or `leak` mode runs briefly.

**Heap dump (optional, careful):**

```bash
# Prefer OS temp — do NOT commit .hprof files
# Windows PowerShell example:
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file="$env:TEMP/lab4-heap.hprof" <PID>

# macOS / Linux example:
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=/tmp/lab4-heap.hprof <PID>
```

Delete dumps after a quick look. Never zip them into LMS submissions.

**Expected result:** Either tool charts / counters move while allocations run, **or** you document “skipped optional GUI; GC logs + Runtime reports used instead.”

**If it fails:** `jps` empty → run the Java demo first. Firewall / permission pop-ups on Windows → allow for local attach only. No VisualVM → skip; not required for core marks.

---

### Step 12 — Reflect and self-check

**Why:** Graders score explanations (reachability, leak cause) as much as runnable demos.

**Do this:** In `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`), answer the [Reflection Questions](#reflection-questions) briefly and attach:

* Screenshot(s) of memory reports
* Short GC log snippet
* Completed performance table
* One paragraph: how `leak` differs from `fix`

Optionally skim [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/) *after* your attempt.

**Expected result:** Notes a grader can re-run and understand without opening a dump file.

**If it fails:** Missing evidence → re-run Steps 6–10 and capture terminal output only.

## Implementation Checkpoints

### Checkpoint A — Workspace + shared types

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Folder `$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement` exists | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | `Person.java` and `MemoryMonitor.java` present (default package) | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | Edited with VS Code and/or IntelliJ per [`_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md`](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md) | Pass / Fail |

### Checkpoint B — Stack / heap / lifecycle

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 1 | `StackExample`, `HeapExample`, `ObjectLifecycle` compile and run | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | Output shows nested frames, identity hashes, create/use/null narrative | Pass / Fail |

### Checkpoint C — GC + leak + weak + performance

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 1 | `GarbageCollectionDemo` with Before / After / After GC reports | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | `-Xlog:gc` snippet saved | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | `MemoryLeakDemo leak` and `fix` both demonstrated | Pass / Fail |
| 4 | `WeakReferenceDemo` and `PerformanceTest` run; table filled | Pass / Fail |

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 1 | No `.hprof` in Git | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | Screenshots show memory/GC themes, not secrets | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | Reflection answers in `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`) | Pass / Fail |

## Reference Commands, Configuration, and Code

### Primary compile / run (from project folder)

```bash
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
javac *.java

java StackExample
java HeapExample
java ObjectLifecycle
java GarbageCollectionDemo
java -Xlog:gc GarbageCollectionDemo
java MemoryLeakDemo leak
java MemoryLeakDemo fix
java WeakReferenceDemo
java -Xms128m -Xmx512m PerformanceTest
```

### Programs map

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `MemoryMonitor.java` | Shared heap reports + GC hint |
| `Person.java` | Simple model |
| `StackExample.java` | Nested frames |
| `HeapExample.java` | Allocation + identity hashes |
| `ObjectLifecycle.java` | Reachability narrative |
| `GarbageCollectionDemo.java` | 100k allocate → null → GC |
| `MemoryLeakDemo.java` | `leak` / `fix` modes |
| `WeakReferenceDemo.java` | Strong vs weak |
| `PerformanceTest.java` | Timing table |
| Bonus | `StringMemoryComparison`, `ListMemoryComparison`, `OutOfMemoryDemo` |

### Useful JVM flags

| Flag | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `-Xlog:gc` | GC event stream |
| `-Xms` / `-Xmx` | Initial / max heap |
| `-Xms32m -Xmx64m` | Tiny heap for intentional OOM bonus |

Maven is **not** required for this lab.

---

## Manual Verification

1. `javac *.java` succeeds with no errors.
2. `StackExample` shows nested frames and return to `main`.
3. `HeapExample` prints distinct identity hashes for different objects.
4. `GarbageCollectionDemo` shows After Allocation used memory ≥ Before; After GC often lower (not guaranteed for tiny leftovers).
5. `-Xlog:gc` includes collector / `GC(...)` style lines.
6. `MemoryLeakDemo leak` rises; `fix` recovers after clear + GC theme.
7. `PerformanceTest` table has five object-count rows.

Record pass/fail briefly in `../../notes/lab4-answers.md` (from project; or `~/java-bootcamp/notes/lab4-answers.md`).

---

## Failure Experiments

1. Null only one alias in `ObjectLifecycle` → object may stay reachable.  
2. Call GC without nulling the 100k array → used memory stays high (reachability beats hints).  
3. Grow forever without tiny `-Xmx` → thrash; use `-Xmx64m` + catch for OOM bonus only.  
4. Create a dump under `%TEMP%` or `/tmp` → delete it; never commit `.hprof`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| `javac` / `java` not found | PATH / JAVA_HOME | Lab 0; new terminal |
| `cannot find symbol` | Missing compile of helper | `javac *.java` in lab folder |
| Identity hashes look equal | Same object aliased | Expected when two refs point to one object |
| GC log empty | Wrong flag / old JDK | Use JDK 21 `-Xlog:gc` |
| Leak does not OOM | GC + OS headroom | Rising used MB is enough evidence |
| Weak ref still non-null | GC did not run | Re-run; document “hint only” |
| IntelliJ wrong SDK | Project SDK ≠ 21 | Project Structure → SDK 21 |
| VS Code terminal wrong cwd | Opened parent only | `cd` into `Lab4-MemoryManagement` |

---

## Security and Cleanup

**Security:** Never commit `.hprof` or paste dump contents (PII risk). Keep OOM runs short with tiny `-Xmx`. Prefer fixing retention over sprinkling `System.gc()` in production-style code.

**Cleanup:**

```bash
cd "$HOME/java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement"
rm -f *.class *.hprof
rm -f /tmp/lab4-heap.hprof
# PowerShell: Remove-Item *.class, *.hprof -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
#            Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\lab4-heap.hprof" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Keep `.java` sources and notes. Leave [`solution/`](solution/) intact.

See [Expected Deliverables](#expected-deliverables) below for the submit list.

## Expected Deliverables

Submit according to your LMS or instructor dropbox. Same checklist as [What you'll submit](#what-youll-submit-read-this-first) above.

* **Sources** under `java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/` (core demos)
* **Screenshots** under `notes/screenshots/lab-4/`: memory/GC runs, `-Xlog:gc` snippet, performance table
* **Answers** in `notes/lab4-answers.md` (reflection questions)
* **LMS overview:** tools used + leak cause/fix (your own words)

Do not submit heap dumps (`.hprof`), secrets, or a verbatim instructor [`solution/`](solution/).

5. Does `System.gc()` guarantee collection?
6. What caused the leak?
7. How did clearing the list fix it?
8. Why are WeakReferences useful?
9. What happens when the heap is exhausted?
10. Which laptop tool would you try first for rising heap—and why?
11. How could a CRM unbounded cache repeat this leak?

---

## Bonus Challenges

Align with [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/):

1. **`StringMemoryComparison`** — `String +=` vs `StringBuilder` timing/memory  
2. **`ListMemoryComparison`** — `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList` memory  
3. **`OutOfMemoryDemo`** — `java -Xms32m -Xmx64m OutOfMemoryDemo` (catch, then stop)  
4. Optional VisualVM/MAT on a dump under `%TEMP%` or `/tmp`, then **delete** the dump

## Success Criteria

You have completed Lab 4 when you can:

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 0 | Module 4 Exercises 1–7 Pass criteria are complete **before** Lab Steps 2+ | Pass / Fail |
| 1 | Work in `java-bootcamp/examples/Lab4-MemoryManagement/` (flat files) | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | Stack/heap and lifecycle demos run; you can narrate reachability | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | GC demo + `-Xlog:gc` evidence; G1/ZGC compare from Exercises 4–5 notes | Pass / Fail |
| 4 | `MemoryLeakDemo` leak vs fix explained with evidence | Pass / Fail |
| 5 | WeakReference and/or PerformanceTest evidence (core or extended as assigned) | Pass / Fail |
| 6 | Screenshots/notes under `notes/screenshots/lab-4/` without heap dumps or secrets | Pass / Fail |

This lab bridges **Module 4 exercises** (after Lab 0) to graded JVM memory evidence.

## Instructor Notes

**Classroom order (do not reverse):**

1. Module 4 PPT (Day 3)
2. Students complete [Exercises 1–7](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) in `module-04-exercises/` (Day 3)
3. Day 3 evening: Lab 4 **briefing/setup only** (folder + notes) — **not** GUIDE Steps until Pass
4. Day 4: OS how-to → this guide — core checkpoint, then Kahoot 4

**Before students open this guide:** confirm exercise checkpoint Pass (stack/heap, lifecycle, GC log, G1/ZGC notes, retention, StringBuilder). Lab 4 pacing assumes those skills already exist.

Solution demos live in [`solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/`](solution/Lab4-MemoryManagement/). Score reachability narrative, `leak`/`fix`, GC snippet, and performance table. Dual IDE on laptop; optional `jstat` / `jconsole` / VisualVM. Pitfalls: skipping exercises; un-nulled aliases; trusting `System.gc()` for tiny objects; committing `.hprof`; mixing `module-04-exercises/` with `Lab4-MemoryManagement/`; using packaged `src`/`out` commands on this flat lab.

**Timing:** Day 4 core ~60 min; extended demos/tools after Kahoot or as homework.
