# Lab 1: JVM and Compilation

> **Participants:** Module sequence is in [`../README.md`](../README.md). **Do not start this guide until** you have finished Module 1 [pre-lab exercises 1–8](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md). Then open **one** OS how-to ([Windows](LAB-1-WINDOWS.md) · [macOS](LAB-1-MACOS.md)). In class, prefer the **45-minute timed path** with [`starter/`](starter/README.md); the **full path** is every Step below (homework / extended). Skip `INSTRUCTOR-DEMO.md` and `solution/`. See [Which file do I open?](../../../_PARTICIPANT-FILE-GUIDE.md).

**Module:** 1 — JVM Architecture and Runtime Model  
**Lab folder:** `labs/Week 1 - Java and JVM Foundations/module-01/lab1/`  
**Difficulty:** Beginner–Intermediate  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes (timed path with starter) · Full path: 65–120 minutes (Day 1 core checkpoint ~65 min; finish remaining steps as extended work)

**Primary IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition · **Optional IDE:** VS Code

| OS | How-to for this lab |
| -- | ------------------- |
| Windows | [LAB-1-WINDOWS.md](LAB-1-WINDOWS.md) |
| macOS | [LAB-1-MACOS.md](LAB-1-MACOS.md) |

> **Environment reminder:** Finish [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md). Use **JDK 21** and **IntelliJ IDEA Community** (primary) or **VS Code** (optional). Workspace: `java-bootcamp` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp`).

> **Hard gate — pre-lab exercises:** Complete **all eight** Module 1 exercises under [`../exercises/`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) and mark their Pass criteria **Pass** in your notes **before** Step 0 of this lab. Lab 1 is graded consolidation in a **separate** folder (`examples/jvm-compilation-lab/`), not a replacement for the exercises folder (`examples/module-01-exercises/`).

## 45-minute timed path (use starter)

In class, use the starter templates so the **core** objectives fit **~45 minutes**. The full Steps below remain for homework / extended depth.

1. Open [`starter/README.md`](starter/README.md).
2. Copy `starter/` into your `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` target folder (commands in the starter README).
3. Fill every `// TODO` / `_____` — do **not** open `solution/` first.
4. Run the starter smoke test; capture evidence under `notes/screenshots/lab-1/`.
5. Mark the **timed-path Pass criteria** in the starter README. Continue remaining GUIDE steps only if time allows (or as homework).

| Path | Time | Scope |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| **Timed (default)** | ~45 min | Starter TODOs + smoke test |
| **Full (extended)** | see Duration | Every Step in this GUIDE |

---

## How to follow this lab

1. **In class:** prefer the [45-minute timed path](#45-minute-timed-path-use-starter) with [`starter/`](starter/README.md).
2. Confirm Lab 0 + Module 1 Exercises 1–8 are done (checklists below).
3. Open the **Windows** or **macOS** how-to (links above) in a second tab.
4. Create/work only under your `java-bootcamp/examples/…` folder from the steps (not inside this course `labs/` clone unless a step says otherwise).
5. For each **Step N**: read **Why** / **Builds on** (if present) → do the actions → confirm **Expected** / **Expected result** → then continue.
6. When stuck, use **Failure Experiments** / troubleshooting in this guide before asking for help.
7. Capture evidence under `notes/screenshots/lab-1/` (workspace root under `java-bootcamp`; redact secrets). Use the **Pass criteria** tables — write **Pass** or **Fail** in your notes. GitHub file view does not support clickable checkboxes.

## What you'll submit (read this first)

Keep this checklist visible while you work. Full detail is under [Expected Deliverables](#expected-deliverables) at the end.

| # | Deliverable | Where / what |
| - | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1 | Four source files | `examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` → `HelloWorld.java`, `Calculator.java`, `Employee.java`, `MemoryDemo.java` |
| 2 | Screenshots | `notes/screenshots/lab-1/` — JDK 21 versions, `javac` + `.class` listing, run output for all four classes, `javap -c` (HelloWorld min.; Calculator recommended), class-loading (`-verbose:class` or `-Xlog:class+load`), optional `PrintFlagsFinal` |
| 3 | Short answers (7) | `javac` / bytecode / WORA / JVM role / heap vs stack / class loading — see deliverables list |
| 4 | Personal GitHub | Private repo `java-bootcamp` (Step 0) with Lab 1 sources pushed (Step 12); `.gitignore` excludes screenshots, `*.class`, secrets |

Optional (extra credit / instructor ask): failure-experiment log, Security and Production Review notes, Checkpoint A–C notes.

### Smooth path — how Lab 1 is performed in class

**Verified participant layout (Windows IntelliJ + PowerShell; Temurin JDK 21):**

| Window / folder | Role |
| --------------- | ---- |
| IntelliJ → `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp` | Your code: `examples\module-01-exercises\` then `examples\jvm-compilation-lab\` |
| Browser or second folder → this participant repo | Read [`../README.md`](../README.md) → exercises → OS how-to → this GUIDE |

**Do not** create graded sources under the course clone’s `labs/` tree. Guides are read-only; code is always under `java-bootcamp/examples/`.

**Before Step 0 — exercise smoke check** (IntelliJ Terminal, from the exercises folder):

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\module-01-exercises
java Hello          # Hello, JVM!
java Variables      # numbers / String output
java Methods        # 30 then Hello, Aman!
java Person         # Aman is … years old
java ControlFlow    # even / loops / switch theme
java -verbose:class Hello 2>&1 | Select-String Hello
javap -c Person | Select-Object -First 12
```

If any of those fail, finish that exercise first — do not start Lab Steps 2+.

**During the graded lab — one Terminal habit:**

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\jvm-compilation-lab
# then javac / java / javap for HelloWorld, Calculator, Employee, MemoryDemo
```

**IntelliJ file creation (flat lab folder):** right-click `jvm-compilation-lab` → **New → File** → type `HelloWorld.java` (include `.java`). Ignore the yellow *outside of the module source root* banner. Do **not** mark `jvm-compilation-lab` as Sources Root.

## Lab 0 baseline you must already have

Before any Lab 1 step, confirm this (from [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md)):

```powershell
java -version          # 21.x
javac -version         # 21.x
javap -version         # 21.x
# PowerShell: echo $env:JAVA_HOME
# macOS/Linux: echo $JAVA_HOME
```

| From Lab 0 | Used in Lab 1 |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| VS Code and/or IntelliJ on **laptop** | Edit `.java` files |
| JDK 21 (`javac` / `java` / `javap`) | Compile, run, inspect bytecode |
| `java-bootcamp` workspace | `examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` |

Maven is **not** required for Lab 1 (plain `javac` / `java`). If any check fails, **stop and re-do Lab 0**.

## Module 1 exercises you must already have completed

Lab 1 assumes you already practiced these skills in `examples/module-01-exercises/`. Do **not** treat Steps 2–8 as your first time seeing `javac` / `java` / `javap`.

| Exercise | You already did | Lab 1 builds on it |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 — Hello World | `Hello.java` → `Hello, JVM!` | Graded `HelloWorld.java` + file inspection |
| 2 — WORA | Re-run `.class`; short independence note | Same mental model in Concepts / written answers |
| 3 — Control Flow | `if` / loops / `switch` warm-up | Syntax comfort only (not a Lab 1 deliverable) |
| 4 — Class loading | `java -verbose:class Hello` | Same flags on graded `Employee` + screenshot evidence |
| 5 — Variables | Locals / `String` | Prep for stack vs heap narratives |
| 6 — Methods | `add(10, 20)` → `30` | Graded `Calculator` + stack-frame table + `iadd` / `invokestatic` |
| 7 — Objects | `Person` + stack ref vs heap | Graded `Employee(101, "Aman")` + heap sketch |
| 8 — `javap` | `javap -c Person`; name three opcodes | `javap -c` on `HelloWorld` and `Calculator` for deliverables |

**Lab-only additions (not in the eight exercises):** personal GitHub repo (Steps 0 / 12), `MemoryDemo` allocation stress, `PrintFlagsFinal` / `-Xmx` practice, clean/rebuild of all four classes, failure experiments, and formal LMS evidence pack.

If any exercise Pass row is still **Fail**, finish that exercise first — then return here.

## Lab Overview

This Module 1 lab is the **graded consolidation** after Module 1 slides and [Exercises 1–8](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md). You already practiced compile/run, WORA, class loading, methods, objects, and `javap` in `module-01-exercises/`. Here you repeat the JVM story with **new graded class names**, deeper evidence, heap stress (`MemoryDemo`), JVM flags, and your personal GitHub workspace.

**Purpose.** Enterprise Java teams debug production incidents in terms of heap size, GC flags, classloading, and bytecode-level surprises. Lab 1 locks the mental model: **source → bytecode → JVM load → execute** — with submit-ready screenshots and written answers.

**What success looks like.** Under `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` you have four source files (`HelloWorld`, `Calculator`, `Employee`, `MemoryDemo`), matching `.class` files after compile, evidence of `javap -c`, verbose class load output, heap-related flags, and short written answers about stack versus heap. Your earlier exercise sources remain under `examples/module-01-exercises/` (also committed in Step 12).

**Depends on Lab 0 + Exercises 1–8.** If the IDE, `java`, or `javac` fail, stop and fix Lab 0 / [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md). If you have not finished the exercises, stop and open [`../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md).

**CRM connection (future only).** Later labs build the **Customer Management Platform**. This lab does **not** create CRM services. It uses pedagogical types (`Employee`, name `Aman`) so you can see object allocation clearly.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to **consolidate and extend** what you practiced in Exercises 1–8:

* Work confidently in the standard bootcamp workspace (IntelliJ primary / VS Code optional) with a **separate** graded lab folder
* Produce graded compile/run evidence for four entry-point classes (`HelloWorld`, `Calculator`, `Employee`, `MemoryDemo`)
* Apply exercise `javap` skills to Calculator opcodes such as `iadd` / `invokestatic` / `iload` / `istore` and capture screenshots for the LMS
* Trace method-call flow (`main` → `add` → return) and complete a stack-frame table suitable for grading
* Explain object creation (`new Employee(...)`) with a stack-reference vs heap-object sketch (same story as Exercise 7 `Person`, graded names)
* Capture richer class-loading evidence on `Employee` (same flags as Exercise 4 on `Hello`)
* Interpret basic memory and GC-related flags (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`, `PrintFlagsFinal`, G1 mentions) after stressing allocation with `MemoryDemo`
* Clean and recompile wisely (delete `*.class` without deleting sources) and re-verify all four programs
* Create and push a personal `java-bootcamp` GitHub repo that includes both exercise and lab sources
* Articulate how this local JVM workflow later maps to Maven/`mvn compile` and Spring Boot packaging (conceptually)

---

## Business Scenario

Northstar Financial Services is onboarding you onto a greenfield **Customer Management Platform**. Before you open tickets for customer `CUS-1001` (Amina Khan) or write Spring controllers, the platform lead requires every engineer to demonstrate JVM fundamentals on **their laptop**.

You already practiced the basics in Module 1 Exercises 1–8. Today’s **graded** onboarding pass list consolidates that work:

* Prove you can compile and run a tiny `HelloWorld` that prints `Hello, JVM!`
* Prove you can read bytecode for a `Calculator` (stack-friendly primitives)
* Prove you understand heap allocation using an `Employee` object (`id=101`, `name="Aman"`)
* Prove you can stress allocation with `MemoryDemo` and talk about `-Xmx` without fear
* Capture evidence (screenshots + short answers) for the training LMS

**Why Aman / Employee instead of CUS-1001 here?** Keep mental bandwidth on memory and bytecode. Customer IDs and REST APIs appear when the architecture becomes a multi-tier CRM.

**Security note for evidence.** Do not paste GitHub credentials or tokens into lab notes. Class files and source under `examples/` are fine to submit; never ship production heap dumps that contain customer PII into public chat.

### Tools in this lab

| Tool | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `javac` | Compiles `.java` → `.class` |
| `java` | Starts a JVM and runs a class’s `main` |
| `javap` | Disassembles / inspects `.class` |
| VS Code or IntelliJ | Edit sources; run the same terminal commands; IntelliJ also supports green-arrow Run |
| Optional VisualVM / `jconsole` | Attach to a live JVM (bonus only) |

**Architecture NOW:** local JDK on your laptop. **Architecture LATER:** same JVM bytecode model inside Spring Boot JARs and (in later weeks) containers.

---

## Prerequisites

Complete **both** of the following before Step 0:

1. [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) (skim [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) if anything fails)
2. Module 1 [Exercises 1–8](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) — all Pass rows marked **Pass** in your notes

Confirm environment:

* **JDK 21** with `javac`, `java`, and `javap` on `PATH`
* **VS Code** and/or **IntelliJ IDEA Community** with `java-bootcamp` open
* No secrets (keys, tokens, passwords) committed to Git
* **Git identity** from Lab 0 Step 10 (`user.name` / noreply `user.email`) — you create the personal `java-bootcamp` GitHub repo in **Step 0** below

Confirm exercise readiness (from your notes / `examples/module-01-exercises/`):

| # | Exercise skill | Ready? |
| - | -------------- | ------ |
| 1 | `Hello.java` compiles and prints `Hello, JVM!` | Pass / Fail |
| 4 | You can run `-verbose:class` (or `-Xlog:class+load`) and spot bootstrap vs application classes | Pass / Fail |
| 6 | You can explain `add(10, 20)` → `30` and that method locals live in stack frames | Pass / Fail |
| 7 | You can sketch stack reference vs heap object for a simple `new` type | Pass / Fail |
| 8 | `javap -c` shows opcodes you can name (at least three) | Pass / Fail |

If any row is **Fail**, finish that exercise before continuing. Exercises 2, 3, and 5 still belong in the full eight-exercise Pass set even though they are not re-listed above.

### Pre-flight

Run these in your IDE’s integrated terminal on the **laptop**:

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
java -version
javac -version
javap -version
git --version
Get-Location
Get-ChildItem $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp
Get-ChildItem $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\module-01-exercises
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
java -version
javac -version
javap -version
git --version
pwd
ls ~/java-bootcamp
ls ~/java-bootcamp/examples/module-01-exercises
```

**Expected result (versions may vary slightly):**

```text
openjdk version "21...."
javac 21....
javap 21....
git version 2....
... examples  notes
... Hello.java  (and other exercise sources from 1–8)
```

**Verified Windows reference (participant laptop):** Temurin OpenJDK **21.0.11**, `javac` / `javap` **21.0.11**, Git **2.50.x**, workspace `C:\Users\<you>\java-bootcamp`.

Fix environment failures before writing Lab 1 application code. If `module-01-exercises` is missing or empty, return to [`../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md).

**Quick exercise inventory (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\module-01-exercises\*.java
# Expect at least: Hello.java, Variables.java, Methods.java, Person.java, ControlFlow.java
# (plus any files Exercises 2 / 4 / 8 asked you to keep — notes may live under notes\)
```

---

## Suggested Project Files

Create everything under the bootcamp workspace (**separate from** `examples/module-01-exercises/`):

**Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples\jvm-compilation-lab`  
**macOS / Linux:** `~/java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab`

```text
java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/
├── HelloWorld.java
├── Calculator.java
├── Employee.java
├── MemoryDemo.java
├── (after compile)
│   HelloWorld.class
│   Calculator.class
│   Employee.class
│   MemoryDemo.class
└── notes/                    # optional short answers for deliverables
    └── lab1-answers.md
```

Ignore build artifacts in Git if you later commit this folder:

```text
*.class
*.log
hs_err_pid*
replay_pid*
```

---

## Concepts to Discuss

Before Lab steps, **revisit** your exercise notes and write two or three sentences for each prompt. Revisit again after Checkpoint C.

1. **Why bytecode?** Why does Java compile to platform-neutral bytecode instead of a native `.exe` on each OS? *(Exercise 2 WORA)*
2. **Class name vs file path.** Why does `java HelloWorld` omit `.class`, and what goes wrong if you type `java HelloWorld.java` or `java helloworld`? *(Exercises 1–2)*
3. **Stack frames.** What is created when `main` calls `Calculator.add`, and what happens to that frame on `return`? *(Exercise 6 → Lab Steps 5–6)*
4. **Heap identity.** In `Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Aman")`, what lives on the stack versus the heap? *(Exercise 7 → Lab Step 7)*
5. **Class loading cost.** Why does `java -verbose:class Employee` print dozens of JDK classes before your `Employee` line? *(Exercise 4 → Lab Step 8)*
6. **`-Xmx` / source of truth.** What does `-Xmx` constrain, and if `.java` and `.class` disagree after an edit without `javac`, which file does `java` execute? *(Lab-only depth + Exercise 2)*
7. **Forward look.** How will Maven (`mvn compile`) change *tooling* but not the javac → bytecode → JVM story for the future CRM?

---

## Implementation Steps

Complete each step in order. Prefer the **IDE integrated terminal**. Opening the folder differs slightly by IDE; compile/run commands are the same.

### Step 0 — Create your personal `java-bootcamp` GitHub repo (first time)

**Why:** Course handouts live in the instructor/participant clone. **Your** code under `java-bootcamp` (including the Module 1 exercises you already finished) needs its **own** private GitHub repo. Lab 0 only set Git identity; this is the first create + first commit for *your* workspace.

You keep **two** Git things separate:

| Repo | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Course handouts (clone) | Instructor-shared labs/guides — read / follow |
| **Your** `java-bootcamp` workspace | **Your** code — you init, commit, and push for the whole bootcamp |

**Do this:**

1. Confirm Lab 0 Step 10 identity is set (`git config --global --list` shows `user.name` / `user.email`).
2. On GitHub: **New repository** → name `java-bootcamp` → **Private** → **do not** add README / `.gitignore` / license (empty repo).
3. In the IDE terminal, from the **workspace root** (not only the lab subfolder):

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp
@"
# Build / IDE
**/out/
**/*.class
.idea/
*.iml
.vscode/

# Local evidence — keep on laptop only
notes/screenshots/

# Secrets — never commit
.env
**/kubeconfig*
**/*secret*
"@ | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 .gitignore

git init
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial java-bootcamp workspace (Lab 1 Step 0)"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/java-bootcamp.git
git push -u origin main
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Build / IDE
**/out/
**/*.class
.idea/
*.iml
.vscode/

# Local evidence — keep on laptop only
notes/screenshots/

# Secrets — never commit
.env
**/kubeconfig*
**/*secret*
EOF

git init
git add .
git status
git commit -m "Initial java-bootcamp workspace (Lab 1 Step 0)"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/java-bootcamp.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `<your-github-username>` with your GitHub username. Sign in with a **Personal Access Token** or `gh auth login` if prompted (not your account password).

**Optional (GitHub CLI)** — after `git commit`, instead of manual remote/push:

```text
gh repo create java-bootcamp --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

**Expected result:**

* `git status` is clean
* GitHub shows your private `java-bootcamp` repo with `examples/` (and `.gitignore`)
* `notes/screenshots/` is **not** listed for commit

**If it fails:**

* `remote origin already exists` → you already ran this; skip to `git remote -v` and continue the lab
* GH007 private email → fix noreply email (Lab 0 Step 10) and amend or make a new commit
* Auth failed → use PAT or `gh auth login`

**Habit after this step:** when a lab or exercise finishes, from the workspace root: `git add` → `git commit` → `git push`. Do **not** commit screenshots or secrets. If you already finished Exercises 1–8 before Step 0, your first commit may already include `examples/module-01-exercises/` — that is expected and desirable.

---

### Step 1 — Create the lab directory and open it

**Why:** A known path under `java-bootcamp/examples/` matches Lab 0 conventions and keeps graded evidence separate from `examples/module-01-exercises/`.

**Builds on:** You already created and used `module-01-exercises/` during the pre-lab exercises. This folder is the **graded** twin — do not overwrite exercise sources.

**Do this:**

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
$lab = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'java-bootcamp\examples\jvm-compilation-lab'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $lab | Out-Null
Set-Location $lab
Get-Location
Get-ChildItem
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab
cd ~/java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab
pwd
ls
```

**Open the folder in your IDE:**

| IDE | How |
| --- | --- |
| **IntelliJ (primary)** | Keep **`java-bootcamp`** open as the project root (Lab 0). Do **not** re-open only `jvm-compilation-lab` as a separate project — navigate to `examples\jvm-compilation-lab` in the Project pane. Set **Project SDK = 21**. Open **View → Tool Windows → Terminal** and `cd` into the lab folder. |
| **VS Code (optional)** | **File → Open Folder…** → select `java-bootcamp` (or `jvm-compilation-lab`). Open **Terminal → New Terminal** and `cd` into the lab folder. |

**Expected result:**

```text
.../java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab
```

(Empty listing is fine before sources exist.)

**If it fails:**

* `No such file or directory` / path not found for `java-bootcamp` → finish [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) workspace creation.
* IntelliJ has no SDK → add Temurin 21 under **Project Structure → Project**.
* Terminal shows a path other than `jvm-compilation-lab` → `cd` again before `javac` (wrong cwd is the most common Lab 1 failure).
* Yellow *outside of the module source root* on new files → **expected** for flat folders; ignore; do not mark Sources Root.

---

### Step 2 — Create and run HelloWorld

**Why:** Establishes graded write → compile → run evidence with a single predictable string.

**Builds on Exercise 1:** You already compiled and ran `Hello.java` printing `Hello, JVM!`. Here the graded class name is `HelloWorld` in `jvm-compilation-lab/` — same output string, submit-ready path and naming.

**Do this:**

Create `HelloWorld.java` in the lab folder with IntelliJ **New → File** → `HelloWorld.java` (include the `.java` extension). Do **not** require **New → Java Class** or marking the lab folder as Sources Root for flat `.java` files in this lab.

```java
// Class name must match file name HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    // JVM entry point when you run: java HelloWorld
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print one line to the terminal
        System.out.println("Hello, JVM!");
    }
}
```

| Command | Easy meaning |
| ------- | ------------ |
| `javac HelloWorld.java` | Compile source → `HelloWorld.class` (bytecode) |
| `java HelloWorld` | Start JVM and run `main` (use class name, not `.java` / `.class`) |

**Compile and run (terminal — both IDEs):**

```powershell
# Ensure you are in jvm-compilation-lab
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

**IntelliJ green arrow (optional after `javac`, or instead for run-only if the IDE compiles for you):** click the green ▶ next to `main` → **Run ‘HelloWorld.main()’**. Still practice terminal `javac` / `java` for this lab’s grading evidence.

**Expected result:**

```text
Hello, JVM!
```

After compile, the folder should show both source and bytecode:

```text
HelloWorld.java
HelloWorld.class
```

**If it fails:**

* `javac: command not found` → JDK not on PATH; revisit Lab 0 Java install / `JAVA_HOME`.
* `error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named...` → filename/casing mismatch (`HelloWorld.java` exact).
* `Error: Could not find or load main class HelloWorld` → wrong directory, or you never ran `javac`, or you typed `java HelloWorld.class`.

**What you should learn**

* Confirm again: `.java` = source; `.class` = bytecode (you already saw this in Exercises 1–2)
* `javac` compiles; `java` starts the JVM and executes bytecode
* The JVM does **not** read your `.java` file at runtime (unless you use tools that compile on the fly—out of scope here)
* Graded deliverables use **`HelloWorld`**, not the exercise file `Hello`

---

### Step 3 — Inspect generated files

**Why:** Makes the compiler’s output tangible so “bytecode file” is not abstract.

**Do this:**

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem HelloWorld.*
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
ls -l HelloWorld.*
file HelloWorld.class   # optional if `file` is installed
```

**Expected result:**

```text
HelloWorld.java
HelloWorld.class
```

**Question (write in notes):** What is the difference between `HelloWorld.java` and `HelloWorld.class`?

**Model answer sketch:** `.java` is human-authored source; `.class` is binary bytecode (plus metadata) for the JVM. You edit `.java`; the JVM executes `.class`.

**If it fails:**

* Only `.java` appears → `javac` did not succeed; scroll for compiler errors.
* Only `.class` appears → you may have deleted source; restore from Step 2 before continuing.

---

### Step 4 — Inspect bytecode using javap

**Why:** Shows that “compiled Java” is a sequence of JVM instructions, not machine code for one CPU — and captures LMS evidence on the graded class.

**Builds on Exercise 8:** You already ran `javap -c Person` and named opcodes. Repeat the skill on `HelloWorld` (and later `Calculator`) for graded screenshots.

**Do this:**

```powershell
javap HelloWorld
javap -c HelloWorld
```

**Expected result (signatures — `javap` without `-c`):**

```text
Compiled from "HelloWorld.java"
public class HelloWorld {
  public HelloWorld();
  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
}
```

**Expected bytecode theme (`javap -c`) — instruction names and order matter; exact offsets may vary slightly by JDK:**

```text
public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
  Code:
     0: getstatic     #2  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
     3: ldc           #3  // String Hello, JVM!
     5: invokevirtual #4  // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
     8: return
```

Capture a screenshot of `javap -c HelloWorld` for deliverables.

**If it fails:**

* `Could not find HelloWorld` → run from the directory that contains `HelloWorld.class`.
* `javap: command not found` → full JDK required (JRE-only installs lack `javap`); fix Lab 0 JDK package.

**What you should learn**

* Bytecode is the JVM instruction format (`getstatic`, `ldc`, `invokevirtual`, `return`, …)
* The JVM executes bytecode, not Java source text
* `javap -c` is your first “X-ray” into what `javac` emitted

---

### Step 5 — Create a Calculator program

**Why:** Integer locals and `invokestatic` make stack behavior easier to see than UI apps — and give graders a richer bytecode sample than HelloWorld alone.

**Builds on Exercise 6:** You already wrote a methods demo with `add(10, 20)` → `30`. Here the graded class is `Calculator` with the same arithmetic story, plus required `javap -c` evidence (`iadd`, `invokestatic`, …).

**Do this:**

Create `Calculator.java`:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        int result = a + b;
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        int sum = add(x, y);

        System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
    }
}
```

Compile, run, and disassemble (terminal):

```powershell
javac Calculator.java
java Calculator
javap -c Calculator
```

**IntelliJ:** you may also click the green ▶ on `Calculator.main`; still capture terminal `javap` output.

**Expected result:**

```text
Sum = 30
```

In `javap -c Calculator`, look for instructions such as:

```text
iload
istore
iadd
invokestatic
invokevirtual
return
```

Example theme inside `add` (exact constant-pool indexes vary):

```text
public static int add(int, int);
  Code:
     0: iload_0
     1: iload_1
     2: iadd
     3: istore_2
     4: iload_2
     5: ireturn
```

**If it fails:**

* `Sum = 1020` or similar string concatenation bug → you printed `"" + x + y` instead of calling `add`; re-check source.
* Compiler error on missing braces → fix syntax; `javac` messages include file:line.

---

### Step 6 — Understand stack and method calls

**Why:** Connects Calculator code to the runtime memory model you will reuse for every Spring request thread later.

**Builds on Exercises 5–6:** Locals, parameters, and the `add` call pattern are familiar; this step forces a **written table** and call-flow narrative for grading.

**Do this:**

Using `Calculator.java`, fill this table in your notes (from reading the code + bytecode, not guessing):

| Code element | Memory area |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Locals `x`, `y`, `sum` in `main` | Stack (locals in `main` frame) |
| Parameters `a`, `b` and local `result` in `add` | Stack (`add` frame) |
| Method call `add(x, y)` | New stack frame pushed, then popped on return |
| Class metadata for `Calculator` | Metaspace (simplified course term) |
| Temporary `String` for `"Sum = " + sum` | Heap (String / builder intermediates) |

Study the call flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Main as main frame
  participant Add as add frame
  Main->>Add: push frame (x=10, y=20)
  Add->>Add: iadd -> result=30
  Add-->>Main: return 30 (pop add frame)
  Main->>Main: println Sum = 30
```

Optional deeper look:

```powershell
javap -c -p Calculator
```

**Expected result:** You can narrate, without notes, that each call pushes a frame and `return` pops it; primitives in this demo stay in frames unless boxed/stored in objects.

**If it fails (conceptual):**

* “Everything is on the heap” → revisit: method locals of `int` are stack/frame storage; objects from `new` are heap.
* Confusing Metaspace with heap → class *metadata* vs object *instances*.

---

### Step 7 — Object creation and heap memory

**Why:** Shows references on the stack pointing at objects on the heap—the pattern behind every CRM entity later.

**Builds on Exercise 7:** You already built `Person` with `new`, fields, and a display method. Here the graded type is `Employee` (`id=101`, `name="Aman"`) with the same stack-ref vs heap-object story and optional `javap` for `new` / `invokespecial` / `invokevirtual`.

**Do this:**

Create `Employee.java`:

```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;

    public Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println(id + " - " + name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Aman");
        emp.display();
    }
}
```

Compile and run:

```powershell
javac Employee.java
java Employee
```

**Expected result:**

```text
101 - Aman
```

**Memory explanation (draw this in notes):**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Stack["Thread stack (per call)"]
    S1["main frame: x, y, sum"]
    S2["add frame: a, b, result"]
  end
  subgraph Heap["Heap (shared)"]
    H1["Employee (id, name -> String)"]
    H2["ArrayList + many Employees"]
  end
  S1 -.->|emp reference| H1
  META["Metaspace<br/>class metadata"] -.-> Stack
  META -.-> Heap
```

Optional:

```powershell
javap -c Employee
```

Look for `new`, `dup`, `invokespecial` (constructor), and `invokevirtual` (`display`).

**If it fails:**

* Output missing hyphen or name → typo in `display` or constructor args.
* `illegal start of expression` → missing braces in the class body.

**Pedagogy reminder:** `Aman` is a lab alias for teaching allocation. Future CRM labs use `CUS-1001` / Amina Khan on service APIs—not in this folder’s required types.

---

### Step 8 — Observe class loading

**Why:** Demystifies “slow first request” and shows the JVM loads far more than your one class — with graded evidence on `Employee`.

**Builds on Exercise 4:** You already ran `-verbose:class` (or `-Xlog:class+load`) on `Hello`. Repeat on `Employee`, capture bootstrap + application lines, and keep a screenshot for deliverables.

**Do this:**

```powershell
java -verbose:class Employee
```

On newer JDK logging style (also valid on JDK 21):

```powershell
java -Xlog:class+load Employee
```

Scroll for lines that mention:

```text
java.lang.Object
java.lang.String
java.lang.System
Employee
```

Redirect to a file if the terminal floods:

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
java -verbose:class Employee > classload-employee.txt 2>&1
Select-String -Path classload-employee.txt -Pattern 'Employee' | Select-Object -First 5
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
java -verbose:class Employee > classload-employee.txt 2>&1
wc -l classload-employee.txt
grep -n "Employee" classload-employee.txt | head
```

**Expected result:**

* Program still prints `101 - Aman`
* Log shows many JDK classes loaded **before** or around your application class
* Your `Employee` class appears in the load list

Screenshot a portion showing both bootstrap classes and `Employee`.

**If it fails:**

* Flag rejected → confirm `java -version` is 21; try the alternate flag form above.
* No `Employee` line → wrong working directory / class not found; fix run first without verbose flags.

**What you should learn**

The JVM loads (and links) a web of classes to start even a tiny main. Frameworks (Spring) add more—same mechanism, larger graph.

---

### Step 9 — Trigger more object allocation (MemoryDemo)

**Why:** Makes heap pressure visible; connects to `-Xmx` and later production memory settings.

**Lab-only depth:** Exercises did not require a 100_000-object allocation loop. This step is new consolidation after you already understand `Employee` / heap from Exercise 7 and Step 7.

**Do this:**

Create `MemoryDemo.java` in the same folder (it depends on `Employee`):

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MemoryDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++) {
            employees.add(new Employee(i, "Employee-" + i));
        }

        System.out.println("Created " + employees.size() + " employees");
    }
}
```

Compile **both** classes and run:

```powershell
javac Employee.java MemoryDemo.java
java MemoryDemo
```

**Expected result:**

```text
Created 100000 employees
```

**Optional run with constrained heap:**

```powershell
java -Xms64m -Xmx64m MemoryDemo
```

Often this still succeeds at 100_000 modest objects; the point is to *practice* setting heap bounds. For a deliberate OOM exercise, see Failure Experiments.

**If it fails:**

* `cannot find symbol: class Employee` → compile `Employee.java` in the same directory first (or together as above).
* `OutOfMemoryError` on tiny `-Xmx` → raise `-Xmx` or reduce loop count for evidence; explain what failed.

---

### Step 10 — View JVM memory options

**Why:** Production tickets often cite `MaxHeapSize` / GC choice; you should know how to print flags safely.

**Do this:**

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version 2>&1 |
  Select-String -Pattern 'InitialHeapSize|MaxHeapSize|UseG1GC'
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version 2>&1 | grep -E "InitialHeapSize|MaxHeapSize|UseG1GC"
```

**Expected result (values vary by machine RAM and ergonomics):**

```text
... InitialHeapSize ...
... MaxHeapSize ...
... UseG1GC ...
```

Example shape (numbers **will** differ on your laptop):

```text
uintx InitialHeapSize                          := 268435456
uintx MaxHeapSize                              := 4294967296
bool UseG1GC                                   := true
```

Record the three names and your observed values in notes (not memorize for all machines).

**If it fails:**

* Huge output overwhelms the IDE terminal → filter as above or redirect to `flags.txt`.
* Flag unknown on a non-HotSpot build → stay on Lab 0 Temurin OpenJDK 21.

---

### Step 11 — Clean compiled files and recompile

**Why:** Reinforces that `.class` is rebuildable output; sources are the assets you protect.

**Do this:**

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
Set-Location (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'java-bootcamp\examples\jvm-compilation-lab')
Get-ChildItem *.class
Remove-Item -Force *.class
Get-ChildItem
javac HelloWorld.java Calculator.java Employee.java MemoryDemo.java
Get-ChildItem *.class
java HelloWorld
java Calculator
java Employee
java MemoryDemo
```

> **PowerShell tip:** Prefer naming the four `.java` files explicitly. `javac *.java` can behave differently than in bash.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab
ls *.class
rm -f *.class
ls
javac *.java
ls *.class
java HelloWorld
java Calculator
java Employee
java MemoryDemo
```

**Expected result:**

After delete, only `.java` (and notes) remain. After `javac`, four `.class` files return. Outputs:

```text
Hello, JVM!
Sum = 30
101 - Aman
Created 100000 employees
```

**If it fails:**

* No `.class` files to delete → already clean; proceed to `javac`.
* Accidental delete of `.java` → restore from editor local history / re-type from this guide. Prefer deleting `*.class` only; never delete the whole folder blindly.
* `javac *.java` expands oddly in PowerShell → compile files by name as shown above.

---

### Step 12 — Commit and push Lab 1 to your personal repo

**Why:** Step 0 created the repo; this records Lab 1 sources (and any Module 01 pre-lab exercise files) on GitHub.

**Do this** from the **workspace root**:

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp
git add examples/jvm-compilation-lab examples/module-01-exercises .gitignore
git status
git commit -m "Lab 1: JVM compilation lab (+ Module 01 exercises if present)"
git push
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp
git add examples/jvm-compilation-lab examples/module-01-exercises .gitignore
git status
git commit -m "Lab 1: JVM compilation lab (+ Module 01 exercises if present)"
git push
```

**Expected result:** Push succeeds; GitHub shows `examples/jvm-compilation-lab/*.java` (`.class` files stay ignored). Screenshots under `notes/screenshots/` remain untracked.

**If it fails:** complete Step 0 first (`git remote -v` must show `origin`). Fix noreply email (Lab 0 Step 10) on GH007.

---

## Implementation Checkpoints

Each answer must cite a command, screenshot, or file from **this** lab.

### Checkpoint A — After HelloWorld + javap

* Show `Hello, JVM!` from `java HelloWorld`.
* Show a directory listing with `HelloWorld.java` **and** `HelloWorld.class`.
* Show `javap -c HelloWorld` including `getstatic` / `ldc` / `invokevirtual` / `return`.
* Force one failure: rename class in source without renaming file (or vice versa) → read `javac` error → restore.
* Explain in one sentence why `java` did not need the `.java` file after a successful compile.

### Checkpoint B — After Calculator + stack discussion

* Show `Sum = 30` and a `javap -c Calculator` snippet with `iadd` / `invokestatic`.
* Complete the stack/heap table from Step 6 in your notes.
* Narrate the `main` → `add` → return frame flow without reading the guide.
* Force one failure: change `add` to return `a - b` without recompiling, run old `.class`, observe stale `30`, then recompile and see the new result—explain source-of-truth.

### Checkpoint C — After MemoryDemo + flags

* Show `101 - Aman` and `Created 100000 employees`.
* Show a snippet of `-verbose:class` or `-Xlog:class+load` including `Employee`.
* Show filtered `PrintFlagsFinal` lines for `InitialHeapSize`, `MaxHeapSize`, `UseG1GC`.
* Optional: run once with `-Xms64m -Xmx64m` and note whether it succeeded.
* State one forward-looking sentence: how CRM services on the same JDK would still be “bytecode + heap + threads.”

### Cross-cutting

* Confirm work lives under `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` on your laptop.
* Confirm no secrets in notes/screenshots.
* Sketch stack vs heap for `Employee emp = new Employee(101, "Aman")` from memory.

### Cheat sheet — everyday flags and tools

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `javac File.java` | Compile one source |
| `javac *.java` | Compile all sources (bash; on PowerShell prefer named files) |
| `java ClassName` | Run `ClassName.main` (no `.class` suffix) |
| `javap ClassName` | Show public members |
| `javap -c ClassName` | Disassemble bytecode |
| `javap -c -p ClassName` | Include private members |

### Quick classpath reminder

```powershell
# Same directory (this lab):
javac Employee.java MemoryDemo.java
java MemoryDemo

# Explicit classpath (preview of later labs):

* `Employee.java` — `101 - Aman`
* `MemoryDemo.java` — `Created 100000 employees`

Instructor reference solution (do not peek until asked): [`solution/`](solution/).

### Sample `javap -c` themes to recognize

```text
# println path
getstatic / ldc / invokevirtual / return

# int add
iload / iadd / istore / ireturn

# object construction
new / dup / invokespecial / astore
```

Submit **your own** captures. Always redact secrets.

---

## Failure Experiments

Perform at least **three** controlled experiments on your laptop. Record symptom → root cause → fix. Restore a working PATH and working sources when finished.

### Experiment 1 — Compile without `javac` on PATH

**Windows PowerShell (temporary):**

```powershell
$old = $env:Path
$env:Path = 'C:\Windows\System32'
javac HelloWorld.java
# restore:
$env:Path = $old
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin"
hash -r
command -v javac || echo "javac not on PATH"
javac HelloWorld.java
exit
```

**Learning point:** “command not found” is an environment problem, not a Java syntax problem.

### Experiment 2 — Run the wrong class name

```powershell
javac HelloWorld.java
java helloworld          # wrong casing (fails on case-sensitive OS; may fail on Windows too)
java HelloWorld.class    # wrong argument shape
java HelloWorld          # correct
```

**Expected symptoms:** `Error: Could not find or load main class ...`  
**Learning point:** The argument is a binary class name matching the file `HelloWorld.class`.

### Experiment 3 — Stale bytecode (edit without recompile)

1. Run `java Calculator` → `Sum = 30`.
2. Change `add` to return `a * b` in source only; save.
3. Run `java Calculator` **without** `javac` → still `Sum = 30`.
4. Run `javac Calculator.java` then `java Calculator` → `Sum = 200`.

**Learning point:** `java` executes `.class`. Always recompile after source edits (Maven will do this for you later).

### Experiment 4 — (Optional) `-Xmx` too small / OOM

Only if the instructor allows a short stress test:

```powershell
java -Xmx8m MemoryDemo
```

You may see `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`. Restore normal `MemoryDemo` (100_000) afterward.

**Learning point:** `-Xmx` caps heap; allocation beyond the cap fails fast.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| ------- | ------------ | --- |
| `javac` / `java` / `javap: command not found` | JDK missing or not on PATH (or JRE-only missing `javap`) | Revisit Lab 0; confirm full JDK 21 and `JAVA_HOME`; new IDE terminal |
| `class ... should be declared in a file named` | Public class / filename mismatch | Rename file or class so they match exactly |
| `Could not find or load main class` | Wrong dir, wrong name, missing `.class`, or used `.java` suffix | `cd` to lab folder; `Get-ChildItem` / `ls`; `javac`; `java ClassName` (no `.java`) |
| Prompt shows `java-bootcamp>` but `javac HelloWorld` fails | Still at workspace root, not in `jvm-compilation-lab` | `cd examples\jvm-compilation-lab` (Windows) or `cd examples/jvm-compilation-lab` (macOS) |
| Changes not reflected when running | Forgot recompile | `javac` again; see Failure Experiment 3 |
| `cannot find symbol: class Employee` | `MemoryDemo` compiled alone | `javac Employee.java MemoryDemo.java` |
| `OutOfMemoryError` | Heap too small for allocation | Raise `-Xmx` or reduce loop |
| `PrintFlagsFinal` floods terminal | Normal volume | Filter with `Select-String` / `grep` or file |
| IntelliJ “SDK not defined” | Project SDK unset | **Project Structure → Project → SDK 21** |
| Yellow *outside of the module source root* | Flat exercises/lab folder (expected) | Ignore banner; do **not** Mark as Sources Root; use Terminal `javac` |
| *Missing package statement… invalid package name* | `examples` marked Sources Root | Right-click `examples` → **Unmark as Sources Root** |
| PowerShell `javac *.java` oddities | Globbing differences | Name files explicitly: `javac HelloWorld.java Calculator.java …` |
| No lab guide visible inside IntelliJ | Guides live in the **participant course clone**, not under `examples/` | Open [`../README.md`](../README.md) from the course clone (browser or second window) |

---

## Security and Production Review

Answer in your notes (for example `notes/lab1-security.md`). Forward-looking—CRM is not running yet.

1. **Bytecode as artifact:** Why might an enterprise forbid copying raw `.class` files between machines without a reproducible build (Maven/CI)?
2. **Heap dumps:** If a future CRM JVM writes a heap dump on OOM, what privacy risk appears if customer PII sits in memory? Who should access dumps?
3. **Logging secrets:** Why must you never print passwords or cloud access keys—even in a tiny training `main`?
4. **Classpath trust:** What risk exists if a malicious `Employee.class` appears earlier on the classpath than your build output?
5. **Flag / container limits:** Why is casually setting `-Xmx` without matching container memory limits dangerous in production?
6. **Production delta:** Name three controls Northstar would add before real customer workloads (non-root user, memory limits, CI-signed artifacts, no secrets in logs).

---

## Cleanup

Capture grading evidence **before** aggressive cleanup.

**Keep:**

* All four `.java` sources under `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/`
* Your notes / answer file
* Screenshots stored where the LMS expects them

**Safe cleanup of rebuildable outputs:**

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
Set-Location (Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'java-bootcamp\examples\jvm-compilation-lab')
Remove-Item -Force *.class, classload-employee.txt, flags.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-ChildItem
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
cd ~/java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab
rm -f *.class classload-employee.txt flags.txt
ls
```

**Do not:**

* Delete the entire `java-bootcamp` tree
* Uninstall Lab 0 tooling (JDK, Maven)
* Commit heap dumps, `hs_err_pid*`, or credential files

After grading, you may keep `.class` files locally; they are not sacred—sources are.

---

## Expected Deliverables

Submit according to your LMS or instructor dropbox. Same checklist as [What you'll submit](#what-youll-submit-read-this-first) above — detail here for grading.

* **Sources** under `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/`: `HelloWorld.java`, `Calculator.java`, `Employee.java`, `MemoryDemo.java`
* **Screenshots** under `notes/screenshots/lab-1/`: JDK 21 (`java` / `javac` versions); `javac` + `.class` listing; run output for all four entry points; `javap -c` (HelloWorld minimum; Calculator recommended); class loading (`-verbose:class` or `-Xlog:class+load`); recommended filtered `PrintFlagsFinal`
* **Short answers (3–7 sentences each, or bullet notes):** What does `javac` do? What is bytecode? Why is bytecode platform-independent? What is the role of the JVM? Where are objects stored? Where are method calls / frames stored? What happens when a class is loaded?
* **Personal GitHub:** private repo `java-bootcamp` (Step 0) with Lab 1 sources pushed (Step 12); `.gitignore` excludes `notes/screenshots/`, `*.class`, `out/`, secrets

Optional: failure-experiment log (min. three); Security and Production Review answers; Checkpoint A–C notes.

---

## Evaluation Rubric (100 Marks)

| Criteria | Marks | What reviewers look for |
| -------- | ----: | ----------------------- |
| Environment readiness (Lab 0 + Exercises 1–8 Pass, IDE, JDK 21, correct folder, personal GitHub repo Step 0) | 10 | Pre-flight versions; exercise folder present; path under `examples/jvm-compilation-lab`; `origin` push works |
| HelloWorld compile / run / file inspection | 10 | Exact `Hello, JVM!`; `.java` + `.class` evidence |
| `javap` bytecode literacy | 15 | Readable `javap -c` capture; can name key opcodes |
| Calculator + stack explanation | 15 | `Sum = 30`; coherent stack-frame narrative / table |
| Employee heap model | 10 | `101 - Aman`; correct stack-ref vs heap-object sketch |
| Class loading observation | 10 | Verbose/Xlog evidence including JDK + `Employee` |
| MemoryDemo + heap flags awareness | 10 | `Created 100000 employees`; `PrintFlagsFinal` or `-Xmx` notes |
| Clean / recompile discipline | 5 | Shows delete `*.class` then successful rebuild |
| Evidence quality + written answers | 10 | Clear screenshots; seven short answers present |
| Failure experiments / security awareness | 5 | At least one controlled failure + thoughtful security note |

Partial credit is normal if optional VisualVM/`jconsole` is skipped. Missing JDK 21, missing sources, or inability to explain `.java` vs `.class` typically blocks a pass.

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Which mental model changed most: “Java runs my `.java` file” versus “JVM runs bytecode”?
2. Why does enterprise onboarding spend time on `javap` before Spring annotations?
3. When `Calculator` printed a stale result, what process would you use in a large Maven CRM project to avoid the same bug class?
4. How does loading hundreds of classes at startup explain “JVM process up” versus “application ready”?
5. What evidence would convince a grader the bytecode screenshot is from **your** `HelloWorld`?
6. Looking forward: which Lab 1 idea will matter first when the CRM runs under Docker—heap limits, class loading, or bytecode inspection?

## Bonus Challenges

Complete only after core deliverables pass.

1. **VisualVM or `jconsole` attach:** Start a long-running variant (for example add `Thread.sleep` after allocating in a copy of `MemoryDemo`) and attach a local VisualVM/`jconsole` only if your laptop GUI policy allows. Capture a screenshot of heap usage. Prefer localhost-only JMX.

2. **Compare G1-related flags:** From `PrintFlagsFinal`, note `UseG1GC` and two related flags. Write five lines on what “default GC” means for a training laptop versus a latency-sensitive CRM API.

3. **StackOverflow recursion demo (careful):** Write a tiny `RecursionBomb` with an unbounded recursive method; run until `StackOverflowError`. Keep the demo separate from required files. Explain why this is a *stack* failure, not a heap OOM. Delete or quarantine the demo after evidence.

## Success Criteria

You have completed Lab 1 when you can:

_Mark each row **Pass** or **Fail** in your lab notes (GitHub markdown files are not interactive checklists)._

| # | Confirm | Your notes |
| - | ------- | ---------- |
| 0 | Module 1 Exercises 1–8 Pass criteria are complete **before** Lab Steps 2+ | Pass / Fail |
| 1 | Work in `java-bootcamp/examples/jvm-compilation-lab/` on your laptop (VS Code and/or IntelliJ) | Pass / Fail |
| 2 | Compile and run `HelloWorld`, `Calculator`, `Employee`, and `MemoryDemo` with the exact expected outputs | Pass / Fail |
| 3 | Explain `.java` versus `.class` and demonstrate `javap -c` (building on Exercise 8) | Pass / Fail |
| 4 | Describe stack frames vs heap objects using Calculator and Employee (building on Exercises 6–7) | Pass / Fail |
| 5 | Show class-loading evidence and locate basic heap/GC flags | Pass / Fail |
| 6 | Clean `*.class`, recompile, and re-run successfully | Pass / Fail |
| 7 | Personal GitHub repo `java-bootcamp` created (Step 0) and Lab 1 committed/pushed (Step 12) | Pass / Fail |
| 8 | Submit sources, screenshots, and short answers per the deliverables list | Pass / Fail |
| 9 | Articulate that this JVM flow underpins future CRM services (this lab does not build the CRM) | Pass / Fail |

This lab bridges **Module 1 exercises** (after Lab 0) to graded JVM evidence and a personal GitHub workspace.

## Instructor Notes

**Classroom order (do not reverse):**

1. Module 1 PPT + live [Instructor Demonstration](INSTRUCTOR-DEMO.md) (Demo 1–4, ~30–40 min) during/after the slides
2. Students complete [Exercises 1–8](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) in `module-01-exercises/`
3. Students open the OS how-to, then this guide — `HelloWorld`, `Calculator`, `Employee`, `MemoryDemo` under `jvm-compilation-lab/`

**Before students open this guide:** confirm exercise checkpoint Pass (Hello compile/run, class-loading ID, stack vs heap sketch, three `javap` opcodes). Lab 1 pacing assumes those skills already exist.

**Smooth-path coaching (from verified participant run):**

* Keep **two windows**: IntelliJ on `java-bootcamp` (code) + browser/clone for guides. Students often search for GUIDE steps inside `examples/` and get lost.
* Enforce Terminal `cd` into the active folder before every command — wrong cwd is the top failure.
* Flat folders: **New → File** only; never mark `module-01-exercises` or `jvm-compilation-lab` as Sources Root.
* Participant clone has **no** `solution/` — point stuck students to checkpoints, not solution paste.
* Signature demos to score: `Hello, JVM!` · `Sum = 30` · `101 - Aman` · `Created 100000 employees` · `javap -c` shows `iadd` / `invokestatic` · `-verbose:class` shows `Employee`.

**Core story to repeat (whiteboard):**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  A["Write Java source"] --> B["Compile with javac"]
  B --> C["Bytecode .class"]
  C --> D["JVM loads class"]
  D --> E["JVM executes bytecode"]
  E --> F["Output produced"]
```

**Key takeaway line:** Java does not directly run source code. Source is compiled to bytecode; the JVM executes bytecode.

**Classroom pacing (Day 1 after exercises):** Pre-flight + Step 0 (~10) → HelloWorld+javap / Checkpoint A (~15) → Calculator+stack / Checkpoint B (~15) → Employee+verbose (~15) → MemoryDemo+flags start / Checkpoint C (~10) → Evidence handoff. Assign remaining Steps 9–12 / failure experiments as extended completion.

**Common misconceptions**

* “I can skip the exercises and jump to Lab 1” — No; Lab 1 is consolidation. Send them back to [`../exercises/`](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md).
* “`java HelloWorld.java` is fine” — stick to classic `javac` / `java ClassName` for this lab.
* “Objects and locals both live on the heap” — force the Employee sketch.
* “`-verbose:class` means my app is broken” — normalize volume of JDK loads.
* “CRM must appear in Lab 1 code” — keep Aman/Employee; `CUS-1001` is future context only.
* Confusing `Hello` (exercise) with `HelloWorld` (lab) or mixing folders — keep `module-01-exercises/` and `jvm-compilation-lab/` separate.

**Grading tips.** Prefer understanding over pretty bytecode formatting. Credit the stale-`.class` experiment. Fail closed if the student cannot produce `Hello, JVM!` or confuses `.java` / `.class` after coaching. Do not re-teach Exercise 1 from zero unless the exercise gate was skipped.

**Environment.** Primary: laptop + JDK 21 from Lab 0 + VS Code or IntelliJ. Reference solution: [`solution/`](solution/). Related: [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](../../../SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) · [\_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md](../../_IDE-CONVENTIONS.md) · [Lab 0](../../module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md) · [Exercises](../exercises/EXERCISES-INDEX.md) · [Week 1 index](../../WEEK-LABS-INDEX.md)

Early finishers may attempt Bonus Challenges; do not skip ahead to Spring/CRM scaffolding until the module schedule says so.
