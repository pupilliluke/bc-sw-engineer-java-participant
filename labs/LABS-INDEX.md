# Lab Guides

Hands-on lab guides for the Java Software Engineer Bootcamp.

- **Lab 0** — pre-course environment setup (`module-00/lab0`)
- **Labs 1–52** — one lab per module under `module-NN/labN`, **grouped by week**
- **Week 1 exercises** — `module-01`…`07/exercises/` (after slides, before the lab)

Instructor curriculum twins (slide PNGs) live in [`../curriculum/`](../curriculum/) with the **same week and `module-NN` names**.

## How to use these labs

1. Start from **[PARTICIPANT-SETUP-README.md](PARTICIPANT-SETUP-README.md)** and **[Lab 0](Week%201%20-%20Java%20and%20JVM%20Foundations/module-00/lab0/LAB-0-GUIDE.md)**.
2. Open the week folder → module-NN/labN/ → read **LAB-N-GUIDE.md** plus your OS how-to (LAB-N-WINDOWS.md or LAB-N-MACOS.md).
3. Follow **How to follow this lab** at the top of each guide: Step → Expected → next step.
4. Mark **Pass criteria** tables in your own notes (**Pass** / **Fail**). GitHub file view cannot tick checkboxes.
5. Keep code under `~/java-bootcamp/examples/` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\java-bootcamp\examples`). Capture evidence under workspace-root `notes/screenshots/` (Lab 0) or `notes/screenshots/lab-N/` (Labs 1–52). Do not create a top-level `labs/` folder inside `java-bootcamp`.

**Primary IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA Community · **Optional IDE:** VS Code  

Every lab lives under its module folder as `module-NN/labN/` and includes:
- `LAB-N-GUIDE.md` — full lab steps  
- `LAB-N-WINDOWS.md` — Windows + IntelliJ how-to  
- `LAB-N-MACOS.md` — macOS + IntelliJ how-to  
- Week 1 also has `module-NN/exercises/` (pre-lab practice after slides)
