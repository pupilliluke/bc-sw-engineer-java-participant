# Lab 40 starter — timed path (~45 minutes)

**Theme:** AppSec — OWASP Dependency-Check, triage, remediation stubs

## Copy into your workspace

Do **not** grade work only inside the course `labs/` clone. Copy this `starter/` into your bootcamp examples tree as `lab40-crm` (merge into your Lab 39 CRM, or start from these scan stubs and wire into your `pom.xml`).

**Windows (PowerShell)** — from this lab folder:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\lab40-crm" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ".\starter\*" "$env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\lab40-crm\"
cd $env:USERPROFILE\java-bootcamp\examples\lab40-crm
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/java-bootcamp/examples/lab40-crm
cp -R starter/. ~/java-bootcamp/examples/lab40-crm/
cd ~/java-bootcamp/examples/lab40-crm
```

## 45-minute checklist

- [ ] Merge `pom-security-scan-snippet.xml` into your CRM `pom.xml` (`-Psecurity-scan`)
- [ ] Complete `dependency-check-suppressions.xml` policy header (CVE / owner / expiry)
- [ ] Fill `docs/threat-checklist.md` (OWASP-aligned surfaces for CRM)
- [ ] Run Dependency-Check once; triage one finding into `docs/security-findings.csv`
- [ ] Draft residual risks in `docs/security-assessment.md` (no secrets)

## Smoke test

```bash
# From your CRM project root after merging the profile:
./mvnw -B -Psecurity-scan dependency-check:check
# or: mvn -B -Psecurity-scan dependency-check:check
```

Evidence under `~/java-bootcamp/notes/screenshots/lab-40/` (sanitize HTML/JSON reports).

## Timed-path Pass criteria

| Criterion | Pass / Fail |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `-Psecurity-scan` profile present with pinned plugin version | Pass / Fail |
| Suppressions file exists with policy note | Pass / Fail |
| At least one CSV row with classification | Pass / Fail |
| Assessment names residual risk + owner | Pass / Fail |

Continue remaining GUIDE steps as homework / full path if needed.
